# Multithreading


## What 

In computer architecture, multithreading is the **ability** of a central processing unit (CPU) (or a single core in a multi-core processor) to provide **multiple threads** of execution **concurrently**, supported by the operating system. This approach differs from multiprocessing. 

In a multithreaded application, the threads share the **resources** of a single or multiple cores, which include the computing units, the CPU caches, and the translation lookaside buffer (TLB).
