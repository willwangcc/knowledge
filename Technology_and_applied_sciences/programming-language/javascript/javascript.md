> JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the **ECMAScript** specification. JavaScript is high-level, often **just-in-time** compiled, and **multi-paradigm**. It has **curly-bracket** syntax, **dynamic typing**, **prototype-based** object-orientation, and **first-class** functions. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/JavaScript)]

## What

### Overview 

JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as **JS**, is a programming language that conforms to the **ECMAScript** specification. JavaScript is **high-level**, often **just-in-time compiled**, and **multi-paradigm**. It has **curly-bracket syntax**, **dynamic typing**, **prototype-based object-orientation**, and **first-class functions**.

Alongside **HTML** and **CSS**, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the **World Wide Web**. JavaScript enables interactive **web pages** and is an essential part of **web applications**. The vast majority of **websites** use it for **client-side** page behavior, and all major **web browsers** have a dedicated **JavaScript engine** to execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports **event-driven**, **functional**, and **imperative programming styles**. It has **application programming interfaces** (APIs) for working with text, dates, **regular expressions**, standard **data structures**, and the **Document Object Model** (DOM). However, the language itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as **networking**, **storage**, or **graphics** facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.

JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some **servers**, usually via **Node.js**. They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with **frameworks** such as **Electron** and **Cordova**.
