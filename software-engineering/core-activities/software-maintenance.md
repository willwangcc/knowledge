# Software Maintenance

> Software maintenance in software engineering is the **modification** of a software product after delivery to correct **faults**, to improve **performance** or other **attributes**.

## Why 

High Code Maintainability is the key to make both the management and the developers happy:

* Maintainability lets a product evolves naturally at a **sustained** pace with controlled cost.
* Maintainability lets developers add new features and improve existing ones without spending most of their time refactoring old dusty code and fixing bugs.

## How

Highly Maintainable Code can be achieved through two simple, objective and verifiable principles: 

* Layered Architecture 
* High Test Coverage Ratio

Layered Architecture prevents entangled code, the well know spaghetti code phenomenon. Dependencies get mastered and when it is time for the code to evolve new classes and interfaces naturally integrate with existing ones.

High Test Coverage Ratio means that when code covered by tests get refactored, existing tests get impacted.

## What

Software maintenance in software engineering is the **modification** of a software product after delivery to 

* correct faults, 
* to improve performance or 
* other attributes.

A common perception of maintenance is that it merely involves **fixing defects**. However, one study indicated that over **80%** of maintenance effort is used for **non-corrective actions**.This perception is perpetuated by users submitting problem reports that in reality are functionality enhancements to the system. More recent studies put the bug-fixing proportion closer to 21%.

The authors make the claim that contrary to common belief, most code smells have their origin in the initial phases of the code and are not introduced over time. The authors futhermore find that code smells are not introduced by less experienced programmers, but by folks who experience high workloads and release pressure.
