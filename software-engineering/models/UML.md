Unified Modeling Language 
  <br><br>
</h1>


> A **pictorial** language used to make software **blueprints**.



## Why

* **Most-Used and Flexible**:
	* You can safely assume that **most software professionals will be acquainted** with UML diagrams, thus making it the **easy alternative** to explain software design models.
* **The Software Architecture Must Be Communicated Effectively**. (This is where UML comes into picture)
* **Abundance of UML Tools** :
	* These tools cover much beyond just drawing diagrams.
	* They can generate code from the design, apply design patterns, mine requirements, reverse engineer code, and perform impact and complexity analysis.

## What 

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a **general-purpose**, **developmental**, **modeling language** in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide **a standard way** to visualize the design of a system.


UML offers a way to visualize a system's architectural blueprints in a diagram, including elements such as:

* any **activities** (jobs);
* individual **components** of the system;
	* and how they can **interact** with other software components;
* how the system will **run**;
* how **entities** interact with others (components and interfaces);
* external user interface.

Although originally intended for object-oriented design documentation, UML has been extended to a larger set of design documentation (as listed above), and been found **useful** in many **contexts**.

### Concepts

* Object oriented	
* Structure
* Behavior
* **Relationship**
	* **Association**: a relationship between classes of objects that allows one object **instance** to cause another to perform an **action** on its behalf. 
	* **Composition**: a relationship where the child **cannot exist** independent of the parent. 
	* **Dependency**: coupling is a measure of how *closely* connected two routines or modules are
	* **Generalization** (or Inheritance): a form of *abstraction* whereby common properties of specific instances are formulated as general concepts or claims
* Extensibility
* Other

### Diagrams

* Structure
* Behaviour
* Interaction
