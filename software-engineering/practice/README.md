## list

1. Acceptance test–driven development
1. Behavior-driven development 
1. Extreme programming practices 
1. **Continuous integration**: the practice of **merging** all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. 
1. **Continuous delivery**: produce software in **short cycles**, ensuring that the software can be **reliably** released at any time and, when releasing the software, doing so manually
1. Domain-driven design: 一种通过将实现连接到**持续进化**的模型来满足复杂需求的软件开发方法。
1. Pair programming: One, the **driver**, writes code while the other, the **observer** or navigator,[1] reviews each line of code as it is typed in. 
1. Stand-up meeting: The **discomfort** of standing for long periods is intended to keep the meetings **short**
1. **Test-driven** development:  requirements are turned into very **specific** test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, **only**.
