## Why 

Problem solving is at the core of human evolution. It is the methods we use to understand what is happening in our environment, identify things we want to change and then figure out the things that need to be done to create the desired outcome. Problem solving is the source of all new inventions, social and cultural evolution, and the basis for market based economies. It is the basis for continuous improvement, communication and learning.

## FAQs

#### Q: solution vs approach?

A: A **solution** is applicable only for problems where the **right** answer exists, such as "the solution of a linear equation." On the other hand, I think an **approach** is more applicable to scenarios where it is **unclear** whether it is possible to reach an optimal definitive answer. May 14, 2020
