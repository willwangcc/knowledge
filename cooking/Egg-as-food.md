## What 

### Overview

Eggs are laid by **female animals** of many different species, including birds, reptiles, amphibians, a few mammals, and fish, and many of these have been eaten by humans for **thousands of years**. Bird and reptile eggs consist of a protective eggshell, albumen (egg white), and vitellus (egg yolk), contained within various thin membranes. The most commonly consumed eggs are **chicken eggs**. Other poultry eggs including those of duck and quail also are eaten. Fish eggs are called roe and caviar.

Egg yolks and whole eggs store significant amounts of protein and choline,[2][3] and are widely used in cookery. Due to their protein content, the United States Department of Agriculture formerly categorized eggs as Meats within the Food Guide Pyramid (now MyPlate).[2] Despite the nutritional value of eggs, there are some potential health issues arising from cholesterol content, salmonella contamination, and allergy to egg proteins.

Chickens and other egg-laying creatures are kept widely throughout the world and mass production of chicken eggs is a global industry. In 2009, an estimated 62.1 million metric tons of eggs were produced worldwide from a total laying flock of approximately 6.4 billion hens.[4] There are issues of regional variation in demand and expectation, as well as current debates concerning methods of mass production. In 2012, the European Union banned battery husbandry of chickens.

#### Q: How to Make a Soft Boiled Egg?

A: Using a Cold Start:

1. **Prick the end of your egg**. To prevent eggs from cracking and to make them easier to **peel**, gently prick the **end** of each egg. You can carefully use a small **pin** or tack to poke a very small indentation through the shell at the large end of the egg. Take care not to poke very far or the white will leak out of the egg.
1. **Cover the eggs with cold water**.  Put your eggs into a small saucepan and pour enough cold water to cover the eggs by **1-inch** (2.5 cm). 
1. **Bring the water to a boil and turn off the heat**. Turn the heat on to medium-high and keep **the lid off of the pan**. Once the water begins to **boil (bubble vigorously)**, turn off the heat and start your timer right away.
1. **Cook the soft-boiled eggs to your liking**. You'll need to keep a close eye on the timer, since every minute makes a difference when boiling eggs. Leave the eggs in the hot water to get the desired consistency. Try cooking the eggs for:
	* 2 minutes to get a raw yolk and very soft egg white
	* 4 minutes to get a really runny, thick yolk and set white
	* 6 minutes to get **a mostly set yolk** and set white
	* 8 minutes to get a tender, but set yolk and fully set white 

Expert Trick: 

* Put your eggs into a bowl filled with **icy water for 30 seconds** right after boiling them. This stops the **cooking process** and ensures perfect **consistency** every time!
* Boiling ETA: 6mins
