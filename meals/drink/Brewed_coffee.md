## What 

### Overview

Brewed coffee is made by pouring hot water onto ground **coffee beans**, then allowing to brew. There are several methods for doing this, including using a filter, a percolator, and a French press. Terms used for the resulting coffee often reflect the method used, such as drip brewed coffee, filtered coffee, pour-over coffee, immersion brewed coffee, or simply coffee. Water seeps through the ground coffee, absorbing its constituent chemical compounds, and then passes through a filter. The used coffee grounds are retained in the filter, while the brewed coffee is collected in a vessel such as a carafe or pot.

Let's say we're making a double, which is the perfect amount for our carafe. 20 ounces of water is 600ml (~600g).

1. Heat your water to **200-205°F** and grind **40g** of coffee at a medium/fine setting (about the size of sea salt). You can use the double dot on the drip cup to estimate 40g of coffee.
1. Once your water is ready, add the filter to the Stagg [XF] Dripper and place on the tasting glass or another vessel that holds more than 20 ounces. Slowly wet the edges to fully soak the filter.
1. Pour the water out of the drinking vessel
1. Add the 40g of ground coffee to the moistened filter in the Stagg [XF] Dripper. Gently **shake** to settle the bed.
1. Pour **80g** of water into the dripper, around 2 times the amount of coffee you use. Wait **30 seconds** for the coffee to "bloom" and release CO2
1. Continue pouring **40-60g** doses of water until you reach **20 ounces** (or 600mL)
1. Enjoy!
