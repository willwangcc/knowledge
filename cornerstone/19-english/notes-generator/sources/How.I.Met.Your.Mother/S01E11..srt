The Love of Words for Dear Baby

00:00:04,577 --> 00:00:06,495
老爸老妈的罗漫史
第1季 第11集
How.I.Met.Your.Mother
Season 01 Episode 11

4
00:00:13,016 --> 00:00:15,893
孩子们,新年夜总是很烂
Kids,the thing about New Year's Eve is that it sucks.

5
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:17,811
当然, 在电视上看好象还不错
Sure,it looks great on TV,

6
00:00:17,811 --> 00:00:20,113
但在现实里, 通常会让人失望
but in reality,it's always just a big letdown,

7
00:00:20,113 --> 00:00:22,990
2005年, 我试图挑战一下惯例
but in 2005,I attempted to do the impossible,

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,388
让我的朋友们过一个很棒的新年夜
to give my friends a great New Year's Eve.

9
00:00:25,388 --> 00:00:27,114
我也有个主意
I had an idea of how to do it,too

10
00:00:27,114 --> 00:00:29,320
但代价是花去一半的圣诞奖金
and all it cost was half my christmas bonus.

11
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:41,308
不错，那就是Limo（林肯的一款车型）
that's right-- a Limo.

12
00:00:47,638 --> 00:00:49,268
噢,天, Ted 这太棒了
Oh,man,Ted,this is great.

13
00:00:49,268 --> 00:00:51,378
好了, 伙计们, 我们讨论下计划
Okay,people,let's talk strategy.

14
00:00:51,378 --> 00:00:54,255
去年我们最后都各走各的,这样很糟糕
Last new years,we went our separate ways,
and it sucked.

15
00:00:54,447 --> 00:00:56,940
今年我们要么一起去派对,要么哪也别去
This year we party together or not at all.

16
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,954
我筛选了你们的派对建议
Now,I sifted through your party submissions

17
00:00:58,954 --> 00:01:00,872
缩小到了5个
and I narrowed them down to these five.

18
00:01:00,872 --> 00:01:01,639
有问题?
Question?

19
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:03,941
嗯, Barney, 你的建议我们收到了，但是……
Yes,Barney,your submissions were received and no,

20
00:01:03,941 --> 00:01:06,626
别想我们会穿着你的内裤去任何派对
we will not be attending any parties
in your pants.

21
00:01:07,298 --> 00:01:08,928
但我发的电子贺卡你很享受, 是不?
but you enjoyed the e-vite,right?

22
00:01:08,928 --> 00:01:10,942
那可真是我内裤的照片哦
That was an actual picture of my pants.

23
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,723
我们要在午夜前去这5个派对
We will hit all five parties before midnight,

24
00:01:13,723 --> 00:01:15,450
然后选出一个
and then narrow them down to one,

25
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,560
纽约最棒的派对
the most awesome party in New York city,

26
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,437
我们就在那迎接新年钟声,还有在新的一年里
and that is where we will ring,nay rock,

27
00:01:20,628 --> 00:01:22,067
狂欢
in the new year.

28
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:23,314
好了, 1号派对
All right,and party number one,

29
00:01:23,314 --> 00:01:25,424
我们会在那见到Mary Beth?
that's where we get to meet Mary Beth?

30
00:01:25,424 --> 00:01:26,287
Mary Beth?
Mary Beth?

31
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:27,629
她在我办公室工作
she works in my office,

32
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,548
她好象对我有点感觉
she seems like she might be into me.

33
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,753
老是找理由抱我
She's always finding reasons to hug me.

34
00:01:31,753 --> 00:01:33,384
所以今晚我们将看到...
So tonight we'll see...

35
00:01:35,206 --> 00:01:36,069
人们总是问我
people often ask me,

36
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:38,946
"Barney, 为什么你总是这么这么有激情?"
"Barney,how is it that you're so psyched so much of the time?"

37
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,823
谁? 谁会这样问你?
By who? Who asks you that?

38
00:01:42,782 --> 00:01:44,988
答案就在这
and the answer is right here

39
00:01:44,988 --> 00:01:47,865
我的, 私人珍藏"充满激情" 合辑
my own,personal "get psyched" mix.

40
00:01:48,057 --> 00:01:50,263
人们都认为一张好的合辑应该跌宕起伏
No people often think a good mix should
rise and fall,

41
00:01:50,263 --> 00:01:52,085
但大家都错了
but people are wrong.

42
00:01:52,085 --> 00:01:54,866
应该全是高潮才对, 宝贝
It should be all rise,baby.

43
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:56,305
准备好
Now prepare yourselves

44
00:01:56,305 --> 00:02:01,182
开始一趟刺激的音频之旅
for an audio journey into the white-hot center of adrenaline.

45
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:07,334
这真的有用
it's working.

46
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:09,060
我兴奋起来了
I am definitely getting psyched.

47
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,937
噢, 天 我已经在危险的边缘了
Oh,god.I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage.

48
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:14,239
得扮机器人了
Must do robot.

49
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:15,869
我们来吧!
let's do this!

50
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,116
- 好!
- 来吧!
-Yes!
-Let's!

51
00:02:17,883 --> 00:02:19,609
司机?
driver?

52
00:02:20,377 --> 00:02:21,815
大家好!
Hello!

53
00:02:22,678 --> 00:02:23,733
Ranjit!
Ranjit!

54
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:25,076
伙计, 你在开Limo
Dude,you're driving a Limo now.

55
00:02:25,076 --> 00:02:26,035
太棒了
That's awesome.

56
00:02:26,035 --> 00:02:28,145
我搬到现实世界里来啦
I've moved up in the world.

57
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,638
你们怎么认识的?
How do you guys know each other?

58
00:02:30,638 --> 00:02:32,173
有次我们一起进了出租车
We rode in his cab one time.

59
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:33,611
很长的故事
It's a long story.

60
00:02:33,899 --> 00:02:34,762
我们还在等什么?
what are we waiting for?

61
00:02:34,762 --> 00:02:37,160
有5个派对等着我们去
而且还是得在3小时之内
We got five parties to hit,
and three hours to do it.

62
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,215
我真希望我能和你们一起
I wish I could come with you guys

63
00:02:38,215 --> 00:02:41,092
但Derek可能马上就来接我了
but Derek should be coming by any minute
to pick me up.

64
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:44,544
Robin要和她男朋友Derek共度新年夜
Robin was spending new year's eve with her boyfriend,Derek.

65
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:46,271
Derek
Derek.

66
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:48,860
他似乎有钱, 有事业, 有样貌
He was like rich, successful,handsome.

67
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,491
我讨厌那家伙
I hated that guy.

68
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:52,313
我会想你们的
I'll miss you guys.

69
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:52,984
玩的开心点
Have fun.

70
00:02:52,984 --> 00:02:53,559
拜
Bye.

71
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:54,710
明年见
See ya next year.

72
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,861
去找他吧
Go get him.

73
00:02:58,163 --> 00:02:59,697
这有点糟
this kind of sucks.

74
00:02:59,697 --> 00:03:00,944
好了, 别失望
Okay,nobody get down.

75
00:03:00,944 --> 00:03:02,574
我们知道会这样
We knew this going in.

76
00:03:02,574 --> 00:03:03,725
我们已经有一位“牺牲”了
We're a man down.

77
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,411
这只是代表我们要去派对玩的更猛
That just means we're gonna have to party that much harder.

78
00:03:06,411 --> 00:03:09,000
Ranjit! 1号派对
Ranjit! Party number one.

79
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,247
1号派对!

00:03:10,247 --> 00:03:12,357
1号派对!!
Party number one!!

81
00:03:16,385 --> 00:03:19,262
不敢相信我们从有小猪的派对离开了
I can't believe we're leaving a party that
had pigs in blankets.

82
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:20,221
如果你们觉得我们能击中
If you think we can beat that,

83
00:03:20,221 --> 00:03:21,755
可以得到个铜的
you got some brass ones.

84
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,482
我们还得去4个派对
we've got four more parties to hit.

85
00:03:23,482 --> 00:03:24,920
如果1号派对是最棒的
If party number one turns out to be the best,

86
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,030
我们只要坐着Limo回来就好了
we'll just Limo on back to it.

87
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,469
我们还没正式认识
We didn't really get a chance to meet.

88
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:30,866
我是Lily, 这是我的未婚夫, Marshall
I'm Lily,and this is my fiance,Marshall.

89
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:32,209
Mary Beth

90
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:34,319
很高兴认识你们
So great to meet you guys.

91
00:03:34,606 --> 00:03:35,278
我也想这么说
My word.

92
00:03:35,278 --> 00:03:37,196
你, 你真友好
You're,you're friendly.

93
00:03:39,977 --> 00:03:42,854
大家好, Barney的美国派对朋友们
Hello,American party friends of Barney'	s.

94
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,923
噢，不
Oh，no

95
00:03:45,923 --> 00:03:47,649
那么, Barney, 介绍下你的新朋友?
so,Barney,who's your new friend?

96
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:49,280
Natalya
Natalya.

97
00:03:50,718 --> 00:03:51,677
噢, 真友好
Oh,friendly.

98
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,458
嗯, 你从哪来, Natalya?
So,where are you from,Natalya?

99
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,418
她... 谁知道?
She... who knows?

100
00:03:55,418 --> 00:03:58,295
前苏联喝翻屁股阿斯坦?
The former soviet republic of
drunk-off-her-ass-istan?

101
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,419
醉酒狂想?
Super-drunk-fantastic?

102
00:04:03,378 --> 00:04:05,104
她很棒吧?
Isn't she awesome?

103
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,310
你的脚怎么了, 宝贝?
How are your feet doing,baby?

104
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,652
嗯, 我喜欢这双鞋
Okay,I love these shoes,

105
00:04:08,652 --> 00:04:11,434
但是我化疼痛为激情的机率比较小
but the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep.

106
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:13,735
我们能去一趟公寓让我顺便换双鞋吗?
Can we swing by the apartment,so I can change?

107
00:04:13,735 --> 00:04:16,612
拜托, Lily, 我们面前的是
一个行程紧密的狂欢之夜
Come on,Lily,we have a tightly scheduled evening of awesomeness ahead of us.

108
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,626
我要你用精神力量克服疼痛
I need you to power through the pain.

109
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:21,503
好吧, Ted, 但这些小狗真的会乱叫
Okay,Ted,but these dogs are really barking.

110
00:04:22,175 --> 00:04:23,422
是真的 我能听到
It's true. I can hear them.

111
00:04:23,422 --> 00:04:24,189
怎么了, 小伙子们?
What's that,little boys?

112
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:24,860
怎么了?
What's that?

113
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,162
你想去... 狂欢?
You wanna go for a... rock?

114
00:04:29,463 --> 00:04:32,053
Ranjit! 2号派对

115
00:04:32,053 --> 00:04:34,259
2号派对

116
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,068
2号派对?
Party number two?

117
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:41,835
没那么棒
Not so good.

118
00:04:41,835 --> 00:04:43,561
我们回1号派对吧
Let's go back to party number one.

119
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:45,192
不行, 不能回头
No,no turning back.

120
00:04:45,192 --> 00:04:47,398
Ranjit, 3号派对

121
00:04:47,398 --> 00:04:49,124
3号派对
Party number three.

122
00:04:50,371 --> 00:04:50,946
等等, 等等
wait,wait,wait.

123
00:04:50,946 --> 00:04:51,809
我们得转头
We have to turn around.

124
00:04:51,809 --> 00:04:52,960
我们丢了Natalya
We left Natalya.

125
00:04:54,015 --> 00:04:56,796
Barney, 我们没谁真的喜欢她
Barney,none of us really liked her.

126
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,563
什么?!
What?!

127
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:58,714
抱歉
Sorry.

128
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,536
很好, Lily
very nice,Lily.

129
00:05:00,536 --> 00:05:03,222
你知道, 她是这个国家的客人
You know,she is a guest in this country.

130
00:05:03,222 --> 00:05:05,907
如果你们背身不理她
So while you may chose to turn your back on her,

131
00:05:05,907 --> 00:05:08,400
我则决定正面与她“相迎”
I choose to turn my front on her.

132
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,360
怎么样?
What up?

133
00:05:10,223 --> 00:05:12,045
我为Barney感到抱歉
I'm sorry about Barney.

134
00:05:12,428 --> 00:05:14,251
别, 我玩的很开心
No,I'm having a great time.

135
00:05:14,251 --> 00:05:16,648
我很高兴你今晚邀我出来
I'm really glad that you asked me out tonight.

136
00:05:16,936 --> 00:05:17,991
我也是
Me,too.

137
00:05:22,307 --> 00:05:23,362
嗨, Robin
Hi,Robin.

138
00:05:23,362 --> 00:05:25,951
Ted, Derek放我鸽子了

就象我对Janice的感情一样
that's how I feel about Janice here.

285
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:21,655
所以我就说我到的时候你的摩托车就那样了
so I said,your motorcycle was like that when I got here."

286
00:10:28,848 --> 00:10:30,862
你不是Moby, 你是吗?
you're not Moby,are you?

287
00:10:31,246 --> 00:10:32,780
谁?
Who?

288
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,739
Moby
Moby

289
00:10:34,027 --> 00:10:36,137
唱片艺人, Moby
the recording artist,Moby.

290
00:10:36,424 --> 00:10:37,383
不是
No.

291
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:39,685
但我们说"嘿, Moby"时
But when we said "hey,Moby,"

292
00:10:39,685 --> 00:10:41,507
你说, "耶"
you said,"yeah."

293
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,138
我以为你说的是 "Tony"
I thought you said "Tony."

294
00:10:44,193 --> 00:10:45,919
所以你是叫Tony?
So your name is Tony?

295
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:46,878
不是
No.

296
00:10:48,988 --> 00:10:50,043
我们到了
we're here.

297
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:51,290
好了
All right.

298
00:10:51,577 --> 00:10:52,824
你们要来吗?
You guys are gonna come in?

299
00:10:54,838 --> 00:10:55,797
你确定?
You sure?

300
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,099
来吧 里面疯狂极了
Come on.It's going to get nuts in there.

301
00:10:58,482 --> 00:11:00,017
有个家伙欠我钱
There's this dude who owes me money.

302
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,935
不了, 我们还好
no,we're good.

303
00:11:01,935 --> 00:11:03,278
我们还好
We're good.

304
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:05,291
新年快乐, 假Moby
Happy New Year,not Moby.

305
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,060
嘿，注意安全
be safe.

306
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,430
为什么我们会觉得那家伙是Moby?
why did we think that guy was Moby?

307
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:18,910
不知道
I don't know.

308
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,348
我看到个短平头的时髦家伙
I see a short bald hipster,

309
00:11:20,348 --> 00:11:22,267
就马上想到Moby了
my mind goes straight to Moby.

310
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:27,925
是Marshall的电话
that's Marshall's phone.

311
00:11:33,008 --> 00:11:35,309
- 喂
- Marshall, 感谢上帝我终于打通了
- Hey...
- Marshall,thank god I got through.

312
00:11:36,077 --> 00:11:37,132
嘿, 小心肝
Hey,sexy.

313
00:11:37,132 --> 00:11:39,242
Barney, Marshall呢?
Barney,where's Marshall?

314
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:40,488
他把电话丢在Limo上了
He left his phone in the Limo.

315
00:11:40,488 --> 00:11:41,543
他去找你了
He's out looking for you.

316
00:11:41,543 --> 00:11:42,694
什么? 哪儿?
What? Where?

317
00:11:42,886 --> 00:11:44,324
3号派对
Party number three.

318
00:11:44,516 --> 00:11:46,818
我就在3号派对这啊...
I'm here at party number three and...

319
00:11:47,297 --> 00:11:47,873
噢, 我的天!
oh,my god!

320
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,503
猜谁走进来了
Guess who just walked in--

321
00:11:49,503 --> 00:11:50,846
- Moby!
- Moby?!
- Moby!
- Moby?!

322
00:11:50,846 --> 00:11:51,997
她在楼上
She's upstairs.

323
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,162
Lily, 你现在就赶快出来
Lily,you have to get out of there this instant.

324
00:11:55,162 --> 00:11:56,504
那不是Moby
That's not Moby.

325
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:59,477
不, 我知道Moby还有...
no,I know Moby and that's Mo...

326
00:11:59,477 --> 00:12:00,532
他有枪吗?
does he have a gun?

327
00:12:01,108 --> 00:12:01,971
快跑!
Run!

328
00:12:03,601 --> 00:12:04,848
噢, 我的天
Oh,my god,

329
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:07,150
假Moby的派对就是4号派对
not Moby's party is party number four.

330
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,205
真是巧了?
What are the odds?

331
00:12:11,178 --> 00:12:12,137
那个家伙是谁?!
who was that guy?!

332
00:12:12,137 --> 00:12:14,342
我们只知道他不是Moby也不是Tony
we know it's not Moby and it's not Tony.

333
00:12:14,342 --> 00:12:15,110
Ranjit, 开车!
Ranjit,drive!

334
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,165
去哪?
Where to?

335
00:12:16,165 --> 00:12:17,795
3号派对!
Party number three!

336
00:12:17,795 --> 00:12:19,425
3号派对
Party number three.

337
00:12:20,864 --> 00:12:23,070
不对, 我刚就在3号派对啊
no,but I was just at party number three.

338
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,700
不, 不, 不对, 你刚才是在4号派对
No,no,no,no you were at party number four.

339
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,714
你一定是看错单子了
You must have looked at the list wrong.

340
00:12:26,714 --> 00:12:29,399
在经历过如此不愉快的事情后
after that rather unpsyching experience,

341
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,126
你们知道现在该干什么了吗?
you know what it's time for?

342
00:12:31,413 --> 00:12:33,427
现在是... 什么?
It's time to... what?

343
00:12:33,427 --> 00:12:35,537
对了, 重振激情时间
That's right,re-psych.

344
00:12:37,168 --> 00:12:38,702
重...
Re-psy...

345
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,689
糟糕!
suck!

346
00:12:45,128 --> 00:12:46,087
噢, 我的天那!
Oh,my god!

347
00:12:46,087 --> 00:12:48,868
假Moby把我的"充满激情" 合辑拿走了!
Not Moby took my "get psyched" mix!

348
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,498
Barney, Barney, Barney
Barney,Barney,Barney,

349
00:12:50,498 --> 00:12:51,457
不值得!
it's not worth it!

350
00:12:51,457 --> 00:12:52,800
我们走吧
Let it go.

351
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,622
我们回到行程表来
We need to get back on schedule.

352
00:12:56,828 --> 00:12:57,979
啊, 难缠的家伙
Oh,nuts.

353
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,651
Ranjit, 你确定我不能帮忙吗?
Ranjit,are you sure I can't help?

354
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,569
确定
No.

355
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:09,008
我遇到难题了（暗指我在尿尿）
I am pissed.

356
00:13:09,008 --> 00:13:11,597
Ted, 我不想你看到我遇到难题
（不想你看到我尿尿）
Ted,I don't want you to see me pissed.

357
00:13:12,077 --> 00:13:13,227
好的
Okay.

358
00:13:14,858 --> 00:13:16,392
Okay, 没什么问题
Okay,not a problem.

359
00:13:16,392 --> 00:13:17,255
他会把车升起来
He'll jack it up,

360
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:18,214
换轮胎
slap on a tire

361
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,228
我们会准时到达3号派对
and we'll be at party number three in no time.

362
00:13:20,804 --> 00:13:22,434
希望Marshall会打电话来
I wish Marshall would call.

363
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:24,256
我猜是线路忙
I guess the circts are jammed.

364
00:13:24,256 --> 00:13:25,599
你知道为什么线路忙吗
you know why all the circuits are jammed

365
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:26,846
因为所有的人都在给爱人打电话
because everyone's calling their loved ones,

366
00:13:26,846 --> 00:13:28,380
全世界的人
everyone around the world.

367
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,107
除了Barney
Everyone except Barney.

368
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,422
好, 笑吧
sure,laugh.

369
00:13:34,422 --> 00:13:36,532
嘲笑Barney Stinson吧
Laugh for Barney Stinson.

370
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:38,067
嘲笑可悲的小丑
Laugh for the sad clown

371
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:43,922
被困在旋转马车上,有西装雪茄女人烈酒
trapped on his whirling carousel of suits
and cigars and bimbos and booze.

372
00:13:44,109 --> 00:13:46,506
转啊转
Round and rod it goes.

373
00:13:46,506 --> 00:13:48,136
是转去哪呢?
And where's it all heading?

374
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,534
哪里也不是
Nowhere.

375
00:13:50,534 --> 00:13:53,411
这样只是因为你丢了"充满激情" 合辑吗?
Is this just 'cause you lost your
"get psyched" mix?

376
00:13:53,891 --> 00:13:54,754
抱歉
I'm sorry.

377
00:13:54,754 --> 00:13:56,576
我不能有忧郁的一面吗?
Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?

378
00:13:56,576 --> 00:13:58,302
不 不, 今晚不行
No. No,not tonight.

379
00:13:58,302 --> 00:13:59,837
在Limo里不行
Not in the Limo.

380
00:13:59,837 --> 00:14:00,988
我们得保持激情
We got to stay psyched.

381
00:14:00,988 --> 00:14:05,265
Ted花了很多心思让大家有个崭新的新年
Ted went to a lot of trouble to make this
an awesome New Year's.

382
00:14:07,797 --> 00:14:10,003
Shothrough the heart
Shothrough the heart

383
00:14:10,003 --> 00:14:12,017
and you're to blame,darling
and you're to blame,darling

384
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,894
you give love a bad name
you give love a bad name

385
00:14:14,894 --> 00:14:17,004
A bad name ha!
A bad name ha!

386
00:14:17,004 --> 00:14:19,881
I play my part and you played your game
I play my part and you played your game

387
00:14:20,168 --> 00:14:23,046
Darling,you give love a bad name,bad name!
Darling,you give love a bad name,bad name!

388
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:30,430
没事的
It'll be fine.

389
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,636
我们马上就能出发了
We'll be out of here in a jiff.

390
00:14:32,636 --> 00:14:33,979
Ted, 我得走了
Ted,I'm going to head out.

391
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:36,568
我的室友在附近有个派对
My roommates are having a party not far from here.

392
00:14:36,568 --> 00:14:37,527
别
No.

393
00:14:37,527 --> 00:14:39,541
听着, 我知道今晚和我计划的有点偏差, 但...
Look,I know this night isn't turning out
the way I planned,but...

394
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,843
你喜欢Robin多久了?
how long have you been in love with Robin?

395
00:14:42,802 --> 00:14:44,049
我没有喜欢...
I'm not in love...

396
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,199
我们只是朋友
we're just friends.

397
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,926
你怎么会这么想?
Where are you getting that from?

398
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:48,844
Ted, 没关系
Ted,it's okay.

399
00:14:48,844 --> 00:14:49,803
我没事
I'm fine.

400
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:52,872
而且我知道她也喜欢你
And I can tell that she's into you,too.

401
00:14:52,872 --> 00:14:54,406
这太滑稽了
That's ridiculous.

402
00:14:54,886 --> 00:14:55,557
等下 真的吗?
Wait.Really?

403
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:59,201
新年快乐, Ted
Happy New Year,Ted.

404
00:15:14,357 --> 00:15:17,138
我不敢相信Mary Beth在午夜前走掉了
I can't believe Mary Beth left before midnight.

405
00:15:17,138 --> 00:15:19,344
她只是得去另一个派对
she just had to make an appearance at this other party.

406
00:15:19,344 --> 00:15:20,975
没什么大不了的
It's no big deal.

407
00:15:20,975 --> 00:15:23,276
我第一次坐Limo是五岁的时候
The first time I rode in a Limo I was five.

408
00:15:23,564 --> 00:15:26,057
在去祖父葬礼的路上
I was on the way to my grandfather's funeral.

409
00:15:26,729 --> 00:15:28,647
我想, 在某一方面, 我仍然在
I suppose,in a way,I still am.

410
00:15:30,277 --> 00:15:31,716
好了, 这里变的太奇怪了
Okay,it's getting weird in here.

411
00:15:31,716 --> 00:15:33,346
我要去给Marshall打电话
I'm going to call Marshall.

412
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:34,689
但他把手机丢车里了
But he left his phone.

413
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,854
Marshall! Marshall!
Marshall! Marshall!

414
00:15:39,676 --> 00:15:41,114
我为你的女伴感到抱歉
I'm sorry about your girl.

415
00:15:41,402 --> 00:15:42,937
你的男伴也是
Sorry about your guy.

416
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:46,005
至少我们在午夜都有人亲吻
at least we both have someone to kiss at midnight.

417
00:15:47,636 --> 00:15:49,170
你忘了我们的小约定了吗?
Did you forget about our little deal?

418
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,088
我还没有忘
Because I did not.

419
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:54,157
我也没有
I did not,too.

420
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,665
Derek
Derek.

421
00:16:00,103 --> 00:16:01,254
工作怎么样了?
How's work?

422
00:16:01,254 --> 00:16:02,789
给你私人空间
I'll give you some privacy.

423
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:04,707
Marshall!
Marshall!

424
00:16:17,174 --> 00:16:19,380
Marshall!
Marshall!

425
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,243
好吧,  旅行计划怎么样?
Okay,how's this for a plan?

426
00:16:20,243 --> 00:16:21,010
我们现在就开始步行
We start walking now,

427
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,353
12:45就可以到3号派对了
we get to party number three by 12:45.

428
00:16:22,353 --> 00:16:23,888
我们在中央标准时间庆祝新年
We celebrate the new year in central standard time

429
00:16:23,888 --> 00:16:25,710
Marshall!
Marshall!

430
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,861
算了吧, Ted
Give it a rest,Ted.

431
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:27,820
什么算了?
Give what a rest?

432
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,217
试着让今晚变的不同寻常
Trying to turn this night into anything more
than what it is,

433
00:16:30,217 --> 00:16:32,519
新年夜是单身汉们
which is New Year's Eve which is he single biggest

434
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,916
每年最郁闷的时候
letdown of a night every single year.

435
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,602
Marshall!
Marshall!

436
00:16:37,602 --> 00:16:38,753
拜托, 来吧, 我们还可以回头
Come on,come on,we can still turn
this thing around.

437
00:16:38,753 --> 00:16:39,999
我们还有10分钟
We've still got ten minutes.

438
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,877
别在试着追求什么魔法般的完美新年了, Ted
Stop trying to chase down some magical,
perfect New Years,Ted.

439
00:16:43,452 --> 00:16:45,370
不会发生的
It doesn't exist.

440
00:16:46,617 --> 00:16:48,535
Marshall!
Marshall!

441
00:16:48,535 --> 00:16:50,069
Lily!
Lily!

442
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:52,946
天
Holy crap.

443
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:54,385
Marshall!
Marshall!

444
00:16:54,385 --> 00:16:57,070
Lily!
Lily!

445
00:17:02,537 --> 00:17:04,647
我就知道我最终会碰到你们
I knew I'd catch up with you guys eventually.

446
00:17:04,647 --> 00:17:06,085
太多要说了
So much to tell.

447
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:08,195
我在3号派对上找不到Lily所以就...
I couldn't find Lily at party number three
so I walked...

448
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,921
走到4号派对去了
I walked to the next party on the list.

449
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:10,785
假Moby的派对?
Not Moby's party?

450
00:17:10,785 --> 00:17:11,840
是啊, Moby的派对
Yes,Moby's party.

451
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,566
看他在我衬衫上签名了
Check it out He signed my shirt.

452
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,553
再猜我找到了什么
And guess what I found.

453
00:17:20,183 --> 00:17:21,238
我听到派对上在放这个
I heard it playing at the party,

454
00:17:21,238 --> 00:17:22,389
所以我把它偷回来了
so I swiped it.

455
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:23,732
- Marshall...
- 我知道 我知道
- Marshall...
- I know.

456
00:17:23,732 --> 00:17:25,266
- 来吧
- 来吧!
-Come on.
-Come on!

457
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:31,116
宝贝, 宝贝, 我好担心你
Baby,baby,I was so worried about you.

458
00:17:31,212 --> 00:17:32,075
为什么不给我打电话?
Why didn't you call me?

459
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:32,651
我试过了, 宝贝
I tried,baby.

460
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:33,993
线路全是繁忙
All the circuits were jammed.

461
00:17:33,993 --> 00:17:35,144
等等, 还有
But wait,there's more.

462
00:17:35,144 --> 00:17:36,007
离开4号派对
After party number four,

463
00:17:36,007 --> 00:17:37,925
我猜你们一定去了5号派对
I figured you guys went to party number five.

464
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:39,364
所以我也去了5号派对
And so I went there,too,

465
00:17:39,364 --> 00:17:40,994
而且那里很棒
and it is awesome.

466
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:43,104
我都想哭了, 那里真的很棒
I want to cry,it is so awesome.

467
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,159
我们得去那
We have to go there.

468
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:45,598
怎么去? 我们找不到出租车
How?We'll never get a cab.

469
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,516
车胎修好了
The flat's fixed.

470
00:17:48,379 --> 00:17:49,722
我们去吧!
Let's do this!

471
00:17:49,722 --> 00:17:50,681
来吧! 上车!
Come on!In!

472
00:17:50,681 --> 00:17:53,078
走, 走, 走!
Go,go,go!

473
00:17:53,078 --> 00:17:53,845
Natalya?
Natalya?

474
00:17:53,845 --> 00:17:55,955
她一直在前排座位上睡觉
it turns out she was asleep in the front seat the whole time.

475
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:57,202
Ranjit, 为什么不告诉我?
Ranjit,why didn't you tell me?

476
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,257
我不想吵醒她
I didn't want to wake her.

477
00:17:58,257 --> 00:18:00,271
她看起来如此平静
She looked so peaceful.

478
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:01,997
5号派对离这里有20个街区
Party number five is 20 blocks away

479
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,052
在城市的另一边
and all the way across town.

480
00:18:03,052 --> 00:18:04,779
Ranjit, 你能让我们8分钟内到吗?
Ranjit,can you get us there in eight minutes?

481
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:06,601
6分钟就可以了
I get you there in six.

482
00:18:11,492 --> 00:18:13,218
我想我做不到了
I don't think I can do it.

483
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:14,465
不! 拜托!
No! Come on!

484
00:18:14,465 --> 00:18:15,903
快开, 蠢出租车!
Move,you stupid taxi!

485
00:18:15,903 --> 00:18:16,862
只有3分钟了!
Three minutes!

486
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,589
拜托!
Come on!

487
00:18:20,603 --> 00:18:22,425
Ranjit, 熄火吧
Ranjit,put her in park.

488
00:18:24,055 --> 00:18:26,932
伙计们, 我相信5号派对很棒
Dudes,I'm sure party number five is awesome,

489
00:18:27,124 --> 00:18:29,042
但它不是纽约最棒的派对
but it's not the best party in New York.

490
00:18:29,714 --> 00:18:32,207
因为这才是, 就在这
'Cause this is,right here.

491
00:18:33,454 --> 00:18:34,317
干杯 说的好
Cheers.Well said.

492
00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:35,756
- 干杯
- 干杯
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

493
00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:37,002
就这样
And just like that,

494
00:18:37,002 --> 00:18:39,496
我们有了那个完美的新年夜
we were having the perfect New Year's Eve.

495
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:42,085
好笑的是,我花了一整晚时间……
The funny thing is all night long,

496
00:18:42,085 --> 00:18:44,387
试图去追求一些东西
I'd been trying to chase something down

497
00:18:44,387 --> 00:18:46,401
结果就在Limo里
that was right there in that Limo.

498
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,771
Derek?!
Derek?!

499
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:52,731
Derek
Derek.

500
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:56,854
上来吧
come on in.

501
00:18:58,772 --> 00:18:59,732
Robin
Robin.

502
00:19:00,882 --> 00:19:02,513
我加快了会议进程
I cut my meeting short

503
00:19:02,513 --> 00:19:04,719
因为我想在午夜见到你
because I wanted to see you at midnight.

504
00:19:04,814 --> 00:19:06,733
我不敢相信你做到了
I can't believe you made it.

505
00:19:07,116 --> 00:19:08,363
我做到了, 宝贝
I made it,baby.

506
00:19:10,856 --> 00:19:13,734
我超级爱你, 可以不?
I super love you,okay?

507
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:15,939
拿着, 你需要薄荷
Here,you need a mint

508
00:19:24,283 --> 00:19:25,146
新年快乐!
Happy New Year!

509
00:19:25,146 --> 00:19:28,023
故事讲到这里你们可能会为你们的老爸感到遗憾
You probably want to feel bad for your old man at this point in the story.

510
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,941
但不需要
Well,don't.

511
00:19:29,941 --> 00:19:31,955
不是每个夜晚都有美好的结局
Not every night has a happy ending.

512
00:19:31,955 --> 00:19:33,586
但每个夜晚都是很重要的
But all of it's important.

513
00:19:33,586 --> 00:19:35,600
所有的夜晚都都让我们前进
All of it was leading somewhere.

514
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,655
因为突然
Because suddenly,

515
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:38,285
就是2006年了
it was 2006.

516
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:41,258
2006是很重要的一年
And 2006 was a big one.

517
00:19:41,258 --> 00:19:42,217
Ted!
Ted!

518
00:19:45,957 --> 00:19:46,629
怎么了, 伙计?
What the hell,man?

519
00:19:46,629 --> 00:19:48,163
我想我们有约定
I thought we had a deal.

520
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:52,287
你的伴怎么办?
What about your guy?

521
00:19:52,766 --> 00:19:53,438
现在是午夜
It's midnight.

522
00:19:53,438 --> 00:19:54,876
去亲他啊
Go kiss him.

523
00:19:55,452 --> 00:19:57,082
他让我等他
he kept me waiting.

524
00:19:57,082 --> 00:19:58,712
我也可以让他等我
I can keep him waiting.

525
00:20:00,822 --> 00:20:02,357
约定就是约定
a deal is a deal.

526
00:20:14,153 --> 00:20:15,304
新年快乐
Happy New Year.

527
00:20:17,606 --> 00:20:18,948
新年快乐
Happy New Year.

528
00:20:27,867 --> 00:20:29,785
