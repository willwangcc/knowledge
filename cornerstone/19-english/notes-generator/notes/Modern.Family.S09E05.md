|232|00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,140|你要是有本事打开天窗说亮话|You weren't engaged to a woman six months in law school|
|233|00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,910|也不会上法学院时  跟一个女的订婚半年了|because you were good at dropping the hammer.|
|234|00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,500|你们不是还一起养了猫吗|Didn't you guys get a cat together?|
|235|00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,780|好了  没错|Okay, you know? Y-Y-Yes!|

|238|00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,740|你唯一建过的一样东西|The only thing you've ever built|
|239|00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,130|就是橱柜  也就是个装空气的盒子|is a closet -- I.E. a box of air.|
|240|00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,220|你走吧|So get out,|
|241|00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,460|小心你的大屁股|and don't let the door hit you|
|242|00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,840|别被门夹了|on your ample behind.|
|243|00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,200|不错|Nicely done.|
|244|00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,160|不过对橱柜的攻击有些没必要|Maybe an unnecessary shot at closets,|
|245|00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,620|毕竟你没出"柜"整整22年|particularly from someone who was in one for 22 years,|
|246|00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,420|但|but...|
|247|00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,850|我明白了|Yeah, I get it.|
|248|00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,310|我去拿我的东西|I'll just grab my stuff.|
|249|00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,500|天啊  爸  你弄完了|Oh, my God. Dad, it's -- it's done!|

|251|00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,730|我看到你怒气冲冲走进来|Well, I saw you marching in here,|
|252|00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,790|感觉要发飙|loaded for bear.|
|253|00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,110|而你很少对别人发飙|You don't usually go off on people,|
|254|00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,260|我觉得让你发泄一下也好|so I thought it'd be good for you.|
|255|00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,830|-感觉如何  -我不喜欢那种感觉|- How'd it feel? - ‭I didn't love it.|

|257|00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,430|我还剩一件事要做|I only got one more thing to do.|

|260|00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,760|还是小卡选的透明玻璃|or the clear pane Cam picked?|
|261|00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,430|你知道吗  我是在跳蚤市场上买的这个|Hmm. You know what? I-I bought this at a flea market.|
|262|00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,560|他们不知道是从哪来的|They're not sure of the origin.|
|263|00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,130|可能来自毁于地震的|It either came from a 17th-century Flemish cathedral|
|264|00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,520|17世纪弗兰芒教堂|that collapsed in an earthquake|
|265|00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,750|也可能是中学生演音乐剧《修女》时的道具|or a high-school production of "Nunsense."|
|266|00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,110|我真心喜欢这个|Oh, I do love this.|

|316|00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,370|这话怎么说都听起来像小卡卖瓜|There's no way to say that that doesn't sound braggy.|

|319|00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,340|每个南瓜  都有一个故事|You know, as with every pumpkin, there's a story.|
|320|00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,610|那是一个寒冷的夜晚|It was a cold, bitter night,|
|321|00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,140|窗户传来咚咚咚敲打的声音|when tap-tap-tap on the window.|
|322|00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,550|惊奇的是居然是我南瓜的藤|Darn if it wasn't the vine of my pumpkin,|
|323|00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,280|在外面摇晃|just out there trembling away.|

|325|00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,560|然后  我爸就把南瓜|Next thing I know, Daddy's pulling the pumpkin|
|326|00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,080|拉进了窗户  当然很小心  没弄断藤|through the window, careful, of course, not to break the vine.|
|327|00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,310|之后几个月  它成为我家的一员|And for months, it just became a part of our household --|
|328|00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,780|大家跨过它才能进厨房|people stepping over it to get into the kitchen,|

|333|00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,670|但没人抱怨|Oh, but nobody complained.|

|338|00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,890|这就是我家乡对待家人的方式|That's how we do family where I'm from.|
|339|00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,040|我老家那也是这么对待家人的|That's how we do family where I am from!|

|403|00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,440|清理了所有和小卖部有关的证据|and checked for any snack-bar-related evidence|
|404|00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,540|才去见艾比|before seeing Abby.|

|422|00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,650|我感觉像个真的建筑工人呢|I-I feel like a real construction guy.|
|423|00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,140|我有点希望此时能路过个女人|I kinda wish a woman would walk by|
|424|00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,560|好让我说点物化女性的话|so I could objectify her.|
|425|00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,640|那最爽了|It's the best.|
|426|00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,310|我们刚刚完成了一项工程|Listen, we just finished the project.|

|443|00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,320|我一转身  你就蹬鼻子上脸|I turn around, and you're in my face!|

|452|00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,300|似乎有不小的骚动|on the dais at pump' fest.|
|453|00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,440|他们为什么要聚集还在世的历任市长|Why are they gathering all the living mayors?|
|454|00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,660|正式宣布|It's official.|

|463|00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,790|这个恶作剧我参考了历史书|I went to the history books for this one,|
|464|00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,730|追溯到恶作剧鼻祖|all the way back to the first practical joke --|
|465|00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,580|特洛伊木马|the Trojan Horse.|
|466|00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,150|不过我用喷彩代替了大刀|Only I swapped out silly string for broad swords|
|467|00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,890|用欢笑代替了谋杀|and laughter for murder.|
|468|00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,110|好的|Okay.|
|469|00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,900|你们喜欢恶作剧是吧|You guys want to prank?|

|475|00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,140|不  老天爷啊|No! God!|
|476|00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,470|他们不过是朝你院子里扔了点厕纸|They just put some toilet paper in your yard.|
|477|00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,740|他为什么要这么对我们  妈妈|Why would he do this to us, Mother?|
|478|00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,990|这是场意外|It was an accident!|
|479|00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,770|毛毛哪去了  我找不到毛毛了|Where's Fluffy?! I can't find Fluffy!|
|480|00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,950|别担心  我帮你找|Don't worry! I'll help you find her!|

|483|00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,230|我为什么觉得这么有活力|Oh, why do I feel so energized?|
|484|00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,160|因为满足了建造这份原始男性本能|Because you honored your primal male instinct to build.|
|485|00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,000|-是啊  -曾经贫瘠的荒原|- Yeah. ‭- Where once lay barren fields,|
|486|00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,150|因为像我们这样的男人|because of men like us,|
|487|00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,090|如今成了灯火辉煌的都市|now gleaming cities stand.|
|488|00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,970|都市又是什么  不过是...|And what is a city, but --|

|490|00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,700|这是我这辈子最为你骄傲的一刻|This is the proudest damn moment of my life.|
|491|00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,270|那让我想起了痛苦的回忆|That brings back painful memories.|
|492|00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,800|好像拐到我们家那条街去了|Huh, seems to be turning down our street.|
|493|00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,920|谁能想到啊|Well, what do you know?|
|494|00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:42,440|中间这块水晶像放大镜一样聚光了|This crystal in the middle acted like a magnifying glass.|
|495|00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,590|-普里契特先生  -嗯|- Mr. Pritchett... ‭- Yeah.|
|496|00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,250|过去两个月内已经发生了两次|...this is the second time in two months.|

|498|00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,450|但或许你买本消防员日历就好了|but maybe you should just buy a calendar.|
|499|00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,190|抱歉  米奇  我也很难过|I'm sorry, Mitch. I feel really bad.|
|500|00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,870|你觉得能不能由你来告诉小卡|Do you think maybe you could tell Cam?|
|501|00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,590|我已经不在这儿打工了|Oh, I don't work here anymore.|
|502|00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,000|菲尔  亲爱的|Phil? Honey?|
|503|00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,450|克莱尔|Claire.|
|504|00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,520|没有瞒下去的道理了|There's no sense in hiding it.|
|505|00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,620|我确实买了个巨型南瓜|I did buy a giant pumpkin.|
|506|00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,380|我猜到了|I puzzled that one out.|
|507|00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,440|你说得对|You're right.|

|562|00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,720|加上你和我妈咪之间的矛盾|Plus that tension between you and Muh-ma -- Oy.|
|563|00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,370|你背着我偷吃了|You cheated on me?!|

|565|00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:08,960|而且她很难过|And she was really upset|
|566|00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,630|因为她得把孩子送去大学|'cause she had to drop her daughter off at college.|
|567|00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,240|你个渣男|You suck!|
|568|00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,250|我竟然浪费了那么多时间|To think I wasted so much time|
|569|00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,090|在你这个爱哭粘人幼稚烂人身上|on such a weepy, clingy, Pez-eating snore!|

|571|00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,080|让你梳我的头发|as you brushed my hair!|
|572|00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,860|你几乎是我交过最差劲的男朋友了|You are almost the worst boyfriend I have ever had!|

|576|00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:38,940|那是爸妈在一个巨型南瓜里吗|Is that Mom and Dad in a giant "punkin"?|
|577|00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,580|至少这次我们没被拉去|Well, at least we didn't get dragged into it this time.|
|578|00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,700|谢天谢地|Thank God.|
|579|00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,800|对  因为我们另有计划|Yep. Because we got stuff goin' on.|
|580|00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,210|小卡|Cam...|
|581|00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,270|我刚刚其实可以|I'm sure that there were better ways|
|582|00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,650|表达得更好一些|for me to say what I said.|
|583|00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,940|你在打包我的面霜|You're packing my face creams.|
|584|00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,360|不用道歉|No need to apologize.|
|585|00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,750|我知道我踩过界了|I know I crossed boundaries.|
|586|00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,200|我从小的环境就这样|It's how I grew up.|
|587|00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,680|所有人之间都没有秘密|Nobody had secrets from anybody.|
|588|00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,690|高中派对时  "真心话大冒险"我们只玩大冒险|At high-school parties, we just played Dare.|
|589|00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,610|我懂这种感觉|I know the feeling.|
|590|00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,310|我也是在一个小镇上长大的|I grew up in a small town myself.|
|591|00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,990|我们还不得不带陌生人到镇上|We had to bring in a stranger|
|592|00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,670|好让孩子们学会不能和谁说话|so that the children could learn who not to talk to.|
|593|00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,790|我必须说  你的家乡往事|You know, I have to say, sometimes your hometown stories |
|594|00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,850|有时听起来是编的|sound a little made-up.|
|595|00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,100|我很抱歉我说了那些恶毒话|I am sorry that I was mean,|
|596|00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,210|我也很抱歉你不再拥有最大的南瓜了|and I am sorry that you don't have the biggest pumpkin anymore.|
|597|00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:26,230|其实这已经和保持记录无关了|It's not even about having the record anymore.|
|598|00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,070|那记录是我让小镇生活留在心中的方式|I-It's just how I kept the small town alive in me.|
|599|00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,840|-或许很蠢吧  -才不是|- Probably dumb. - ‭No.|
|600|00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,840|离开自己热爱的地方  是很艰难的事|It's hard when you have to leave a place you love.|
|601|00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,020|每一年  那地方好像都在渐渐消失|Every year, it feels like more of it fades away.|
|602|00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,270|我会很难过  因为我知道|I get very sad because I know|
|603|00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:43,260|我的口音几乎完全消失了|that my accent is almost completely gone.|
|604|00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,760|总之  我该走了|Anyway, I-I should go.|
|605|00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,540|等等  我有东西给你|Wait. I have something for you.|
|606|00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,510|一颗南瓜籽|A pumpkin seed?|
|607|00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:55,110|我想或许明年它也能打破记录|I think it can be next year's record-breaker.|
|608|00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,370|天啊  歌洛莉亚|Oh, my... Gloria...|
|609|00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,470|好了|Okay!|

|613|00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,950|乘着巨型蔬菜|In a giant vegetable!|
|614|00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,290|当家人年纪渐长  你有两个选择|As families get older, you have two options --|
|615|00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,900|你可以强迫大家在一起|you can force everyone together,|
|616|00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,320|也可以接受传统会消失|or you can accept that traditions die|
|617|00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,760|人会往前迈进|and people move on.|
|618|00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,310|除非你刚好有个巨型南瓜|Unless you happen to have a giant pumpkin.|
|619|00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,990|你们来这儿干什么呢|Hey! What are you guys doing here?|
|620|00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:21,880|我们收到暗示了|We got the hint.|
|621|00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,710|我们也来玩  你们才会开心|It wasn't gonna be fun unless we were here, too,|
|622|00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,060|所以我们追踪了你们的手机|so we tracked your phones.|
|623|00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,170|小卡说|Cam says the record|
|624|00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:29,260|北美45米南瓜赛艇的记录是18秒|for the North American 50-yard pumpkin dash is 18 seconds.|

|634|00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,470|事情的始末是这样的|All right, here's what happened.|
|635|00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,100|就在你刚发完短信说厨房弄好后|Right after you sent the text saying the kitchen was done,|
|636|00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,380|检查员忽然上门突击检查|the inspector popped in for a little surprise visit.|
|637|00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,120|现在厨房的装修不合规|Now, it's before violations.|
|638|00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,370|我们得迟几周才能完工|Which pushes us back for a couple of weeks now.|
|639|00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,640|说是我的错  我可以承受小卡的怒火|Blame me. I can take the heat from Cam.|
|640|00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,120|但你们得去克莱尔家住|You stay with Claire.|
|641|00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,710|-因为我承受不住歌洛莉亚的怒火  -好|- 'Cause I can't take the heat from Gloria. - Right.|
|642|00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,290|你一个字都别说  都交给我|Not a word. I do all the talking.|
|643|00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,740|因为你很不会说谎|Because you're a terrible liar.|
|644|00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,210|你来了  今天怎么样|Hey, there you are. Good day?|
|645|00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,100|你这是什么意思|What...what's that supposed to mean?|
|646|00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,350|你只有心虚的时候才会嗯哼|You only say that when you're guilty.|
|647|00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,330|你身上有烟的味道|You smell like smoke.|
|648|00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,780|天啊  你又把厨房烧毁了吗|Oh my god. Did you burn the kitchen down again?|
|649|00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,860|就好像你根本不希望我帮你一样|It's like you don't want me to help you.|
