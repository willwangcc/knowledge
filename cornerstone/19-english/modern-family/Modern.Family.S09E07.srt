{\pos(190,220)}感恩节晚餐

23
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,170
大家都有酒了吗  我要开始感恩节祝酒了
Does everyone have a glass? I'm just giving my Thanksgiving toast.

24
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,470
拜托老爸  你不觉得这样很怪吗
Oh, come on, Dad. Isn't it weird that 

25
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,540
每年都要选一个不知为何
every year you single out one person 

26
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,920
反正就是让你觉得格外骄傲的人
who somehow made you extra proud this year?

27
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,750
这让我们其他人觉得...
It makes the rest of us feel like we --

28
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:11,700
是你  克莱尔
It's you, Claire.

29
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,260
真棒  我就知道
Yeah! I knew it!

30
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,190
还有你  菲尔  米奇尔
And you, Phil, and you, Mitchell.

31
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,480
实际上是你们所有人
Actually, it's all of you.

32
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,170
我知道我在家庭中引发竞争
I know I get a hard time

33
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,300
你们都对我都颇有微词
for stirring up competition in the family,

34
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,780
但瞧瞧结果
but look at the results.

35
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,970
菲尔新开了家魔术用品店
Phil scoring with his new magic shop.

36
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,680
小卡带的球队赢得了重要比赛
Cam winning the big game.

37
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,200
克莱尔赢了跑步比赛
Claire winning the race.

38
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,500
而米奇尔吓跑了那个小偷
And Mitchell scaring away that burglar.

39
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,060
你也是赢家  杰
And you are a winner, too, Jay.

40
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,080
他想跟乔共度更多时光
He wanted to spend more time with Joe,

41
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,650
所以他每天
so he's dropping him off

42
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,100
都送他上学  接他放学
and picking him up from school every day.

43
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,240
爸爸  她怎么了
Dad, what is wrong with her?

44
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,190
我挑战她
I challenged her to get

45
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,450
一周内走十万步
to 100,000 steps in a week.

46
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,810
-那很容易  -真容易
- That's easy. - That's so easy.

47
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,990
不算购物
Without shopping.

48
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,450
-我明白挑战难处了  -不
- I get -- I get the challenge. - No. 

49
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,970
她还剩1000步就获得荣誉了
She's 1,000 steps from glory.

50
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,950
跟你们一样
Like the rest of you,

51
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,890
她的动力来源于我吝啬赞美
she was motivated by my stingy praise.

52
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,190
我环顾四周  看到的全是赢家
As I look around the room, I see nothing but winners,

53
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,750
我感到十分骄傲
and I couldn't be prouder.

54
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,080
敬我们
To us!

55
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,440
这里的每个人都是赢家
Everyone here is a winner.

56
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,540
{\an8}那天早些时候

57
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,110
你知道这场重要比赛让我很紧张
You knew I was nervous about the big game,

58
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,540
所以你拿出了我的  好吧
so you set out my -- Okay.

59
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,530
糖屑是给英雄准备的
Sprinkles are for heroes.

60
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,480
给  二爸
Here, Daddy.

61
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,590
谢谢你保护我们
Thank you for protecting us.

62
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,140
我们都为米奇尔那天做的事感到骄傲
We're all so proud of Mitchell about what happened the other day.

63
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,440
我的想法是我们可以...
What I was thinking was, we could...

64
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,700
天啊
Oh, my gosh!

65
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:32,830
有人闯入了吗
Was there a break-in?

66
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,390
对啊对啊  简直要疯了
Yeah, yeah. It was -- It was crazy.

67
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,020
我当时就冲他吼叫
I just started yelling at him,

68
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,740
我好像就把他吓跑了  所以...
and I guess I scared him away, so...

69
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,490
天啊  亲爱的  你没事吧
Oh, my gosh, sweetie. Are you okay?

70
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,970
是的  我没事
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

71
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,520
-你真勇敢  -宝贝
- You're so brave. - Oh, honey.

72
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,000
万分骄傲
So proud.

73
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,640
如果小偷回来了  而勇敢二爸不在的话
If the robber comes back when Brave Daddy isn't here,

74
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,440
-我们可以用这个  -不不
- we can use these. - Okay, no, no, no, no.

75
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,760
那是我在学校没收的
I had to confiscate those at school.

76
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,640
这很危险
They're very dangerous,

77
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,100
而且你最好还是避开这种亚洲人爱玩的玩意
and, plus, you should avoid the cliche.

78
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,060
没收违禁品是我在学校新工作的一部分
Confiscating contraband is part of my new job at school.

79
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,050
我最近升职为
I was recently promoted to

80
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,980
代理[演戏]副校长了
acting vice principal.

81
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,700
这跟演戏毫无关系
Which has nothing to do with acting.

82
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,350
他们非常明确地跟我说了
That was made very clear to me.

83
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,000
你看起来有些紧张
Hey. Hey. Y-You seem a little nervous.

84
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,470
你是在担心这场重要比赛吗
Are you -- Are you worried about the big game?

85
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,030
是啊  我有些紧张
Yeah. I'm a little nervous.

86
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,610
响尾蛇队过去六年里都打败了我们
The Rattlesnakes have beat us the last six years,

87
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,030
而我们不能输
and we cannot lose.

88
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,510
你这么紧张是因为他们的教练是女人吗
Is any of this because their coach is a woman?

89
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,540
我们不该支持她吗  因为
I mean, shouldn't we be rooting for her, because --

90
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,580
因为她是另一个执教橄榄球的直女吗
Oh, what, because she's another straight person coaching football?

91
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,560
-祝你好运  -谢谢你  亲爱的
- Well, good luck. - Thank you, sweetie.

92
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,380
我无法保证我让你感受到的骄傲
You know, I can't promise that I'll make you as proud as your daddy 

93
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,010
和打跑了小偷的二爸一样多  但我会努力
who fought off a burglar, but I will try.

94
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,790
有传言说后援俱乐部
You know, there's murmurs that the booster club

95
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,070
要把给我们的一些经费转给科学项目
is gonna divert some of our money to the science program.

96
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,470
因为这样就能让肯尼迪们变酷
Because that's what made the Kennedys cool, you know --

97
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,700
在草坪上玩科学什么的
playing science on the lawn.

98
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,310
第一个想出怎么把号码布一次贴到位的人
Ow! The first person who figures out how to stick these numbers 

99
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,570
肯定能发大财
right on is gonna be rich.

100
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,980
你可以在穿上背心之前先贴好啊
You could just pin it to your shirt before you put it on.

101
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,350
你跟别人分享过这个点子吗
Have you shared this idea with anyone else?

102
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,060
艾丽克斯小时候  我会把她放进慢跑婴儿车里
When Alex was a baby, I used to throw her in a jogging stroller,

103
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,160
她是我的跑步伙伴
and she was my running buddy.

104
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,720
这周她得知我要跑一万米时
This week, when she found out I was doing a 10K,

105
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,830
就坚持要来
she insisted on coming.

106
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,830
无聊死了
Snore.

107
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,260
我把我妈当做我的白痴心理学论文的对象
I'm using my mom as a subject for my stupid psych paper

108
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,430
因为我开始太晚了  没法领走猴子了
because I started too late to sign out a monkey.

109
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,920
论文是关于积极与消极强化的
It's about positive versus negative reinforcement.

110
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,420
比赛前半程我会喊  "你能做到的  妈"
First half of the race -- "You can do it, Mom!"

111
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,980
后半程则是  "算了吧  女人"
Second half -- "It's not your day, lady!"

112
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,020
幸好  做完实验后
Thankfully, after it's done,

113
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,150
给猴子买的香蕉可以给她吃
I'll still be able to give out the banana I bought.

114
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,090
多谢你照顾乔
Thank you so much for taking care of Joe.

115
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,880
我还得去店里买点晚餐食材
I still have to get some things from the store for dinner.

116
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,290
没问题
It's no problem.

117
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,440
我有很多知识可以传授
I got a lot of knowledge to pass on.

118
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,430
你有在持续练习打嗝吗
You been practicing your burping drills?

119
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,870
是的
Yes!

120
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,620
-好些了  -好  闲聊完了
- Better. - Okay, enough chitchat.

121
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,540
给我促销的VIP票
Give me the V.I.P. Pass for the sale.

122
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,650
大家都听说过H.布朗夫曼服装的
Everybody's heard of the H. Bronfman Clothiers

123
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,780
黑五促销  那时候大伙儿
Black Friday sale where the hoi polloi

124
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,610
像动物一样疯狂争抢晚礼服
fight over tuxedos like animals.

125
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,460
但是在感恩节
But on Thanksgiving Day,

126
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,970
极少数人会受邀当第一批进场的买家
a select few are invited to get first crack.

127
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,600
如果我能把要的都买齐
If I get everything I want,

128
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:44,190
我的燕尾服就会在小姑娘房里脱到只剩两成
that tux will be 80% off in Tammy Bosworth's dorm room.

129
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,280
黑金卡
Black gold.

130
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,110
这是俱乐部成员当做小费给我的
I got it as a tip from some club members

131
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,450
他让我弄来几瓶灰雁伏特加
who had me "deal" with some geese.

132
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,180
你休想玷污这次体验
You will not taint this experience.

133
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,950
克莱尔  你为什么贴着号码布
Claire, why do you have that number?

134
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,560
你参加选美比赛了吗
Are you in a pageant?

135
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,160
她要跑一万米  她的表现一定会很棒
She's running a 10K. And she is going to do great.

136
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,760
我就知道你会让我们感到骄傲
I know that you're gonna make us oh-so proud!

137
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,220
显然这本该是群抱
Obviously, this was meant to be a group hug,

138
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,550
而我的邀请函在邮寄时遗失了
and my invitation got lost in the mail. Mm.

139
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,670
菲尔  你为了变魔术
Phil... that crazy phone booth

140
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,280
订的那个疯狂电话亭

141
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,030
已经在我家了
It's already at my house.

142
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,680
提前两天到了吗
It's here two days early?!

143
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,880
我今天就能拍摄教程
I can shoot my how-to video today!

144
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,320
海莉  好戏上演了 
Haley! Showtime!

145
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,920
毫无疑问  二战中
It goes without saying that the greatest trick

146
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,660
最伟大的魔术就是诺曼底电话亭
to come out of World War II is the Normandy Phone Booth.

147
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,530
多年来  它的名声时起时落
Over the years, its reputation has ebbed and flowed.

148
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,470
众所周知  在1969年的
It was famously booed

149
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,970
纳拉干塞特魔术节上它遭到了大家的喝倒彩
at the 1969 Narragansett Magic Festival.

150
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,380
当然  那时候
Of course, this is a time

151
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,440
大部分人都在抗议魔术
when most people are into protest magic.

152
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,860
所以很自然  他们会对经典魔术嗤之以鼻 
So naturally, they would thumb their nose at a classic trick

153
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,210
那就是一个英勇的士兵冲进电话亭
where a heroic soldier dashes into a phone booth

154
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,370
打了拯救世界的电话
to make a world-saving call

155
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,680
而电话亭慢慢灌满了水
while it slowly fills with water!

156
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,630
这多赞啊  嬉皮士们
Come on, hippies!

157
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,390
天啊
God!

158
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,810
小家伙  你出去玩吧
All right, buddy. Run outside and play real quick.

159
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,520
我要去楼上忙些事
I'm gonna take care of something upstairs.

160
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,170
我得更新我在
I had to update my profile pic

161
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,720
一款新社交媒体软件"内缝线"上的用户照片
on this new social-media app called Inseam.

162
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,510
这软件超酷的  基本还没人知道
It's super cool. No one knows about it.

163
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,120
有些老家伙用它分享自制成衣
Some old guys were using it for home tailoring,

164
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,440
但之后两个布鲁克林DJ
but then two Brooklyn deejays

165
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,000
开始在上面分享一些视频  然后就火了
started sharing a couple of videos on it, and it blew up.

166
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,190
太严肃了
Not approachable.

167
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,380
太亲和了
Too approachable.

168
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,730
完美
There's my guy.

169
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,100
怎么了
What's up?

170
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,210
伙计  我刚准备离开
Dude, I was just about to leave,

171
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,030
结果在内缝线上看见了你的新照片
and I saw your new pic popped up on Inseam.

172
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,060
你也用内缝线吗
You're on Inseam?

173
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,300
是的  我已经用了一周了
Yes, I've been on it for a week.

174
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,490
你看看照片  乔在你身后的树上
Okay, look at your picture. Joe is in a tree behind you.

175
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,330
天啊  他就在那里
Oh, my God, he's right there!

176
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,540
等等  乔
Hang on, Joe!

177
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,380
喂
Hello?

178
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,950
乔怎么了
What's going on with Joe?

179
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,010
你也用内缝线吗
You're on Inseam?

180
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,070
当然了
Of course I'm on Inseam.

181
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,020
我儿子挂在树上了吗
Is my son hanging from a tree?

182
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,170
真棒  你信了
Oh, that's great! You fell for it.

183
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,980
我的改图技术越来越出神入化啊
I'm, uh -- I'm getting pretty good at Photoshop.

184
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,330
那是假照片吗
That's a fake picture?

185
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,710
是啊  我有许多张乔做危险事情的照片
Yeah, I got a bunch of Joe doing dangerous stuff.

186
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,980
那你晚点给我看看  好吗
You're gonna have to show me this later, okay?

187
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,010
没问题
Will do.

188
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,330
都怪你
Well, thanks to you,

189
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,230
我现在满身大汗  都没办法
now I'm all sweaty, and it's gonna be impossible

190
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,430
鉴定丝绸衬衫了
to judge the silk shirts.

191
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,170
应该宽松飘逸  而不是黏身上
They're supposed to blouse, not cling.

192
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,740
能让我看看这张卡吗
Hey, can I see that card for a second?

193
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,110
-你干什么  -等你把乔的头P到鳄鱼嘴里
- What are you doing? - I'll put this card back in your hand

194
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,680
我才会把这张卡交还给你
when you Photoshop that kid's head in an alligator's mouth.

195
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,500
上游河谷在二码线上
Upper Valley on the 2-yard line

196
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,780
比赛时间还剩十秒
with 10 seconds to go.

197
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,840
一个触地得分将会获胜
A touchdown will win the game.

198
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,830
暂停  暂停
Okay, timeout! Timeout!

199
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,450
加油  海豚队
Let's go, Dolphins!

200
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,450
教练  我们怎么防守
Coach, what is our defense?

201
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,970
好吧  按理说应该用奔跑达阵
Okay, you know what? It's a running situation,

202
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,840
但他们用传球虐我们一天了
but they've been killing us with that pass all day.

203
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,500
我的直觉认为他们要传球  但是...
My gut tells me they're gonna pass, but

204
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,680
好吧  让我想想
Okay, just let me think about it.

205
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,720
让开
Move. Move!

206
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,190
那些蠢货
Those dumb bastards

207
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,370
肯定会认为我们要传球  所以我们要奔跑
are going to be thinking pass, which is why we're going to run.

208
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,110
左边用2包围防守
Trap Two, on the left side.

209
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,310
我的副校长对讲机
My vice principal walkie-talkie

210
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,250
不小心收听到了上游河谷教练
accidentally picked up that Upper Valley coach

211
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,440
说出她的白痴娘们战术
calling her dumb lady play.

212
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,110
我要改变我的防守策略吗
Now, was I gonna change my defense?

213
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,630
只有没有骨气  全力争胜  追名逐利的人
Only some spineless win-at-all-costs glory hound

214
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,180
才会选择赢  而不是展示高风亮节
would choose winning over showing some moral fiber.

215
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,510
海豚队赢了  海豚队赢了
Dolphins win! Dolphins win!

216
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,230
{\an8}感恩节晚餐

217
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,380
体育场里的所有人  包括我
Everybody in that stadium, including me...

218
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,640
-是啊  -都以为对方会传球
- Well... - was expecting a pass.

219
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,620
但你的直觉告诉你不会那样
But your instincts told you something else.

220
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,840
真了不起  我的朋友
That's big-time, my friend.

221
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,670
谢谢你这么说  杰  谢谢你
Well, I-I-I appreciate it, Jay. Uh, thank you.

222
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,660
米奇尔
Mitchell!

223
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,560
我是个骗子
I'm a fraud.

224
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,980
那就别再和那个咖啡师吹牛
Well, then stop telling that barista

225
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,810
说你在百老汇做过沙威[悲惨世界]的替角
that you understudied Javert on Broadway.

226
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,610
他知道你叫什么  上网一查就发现了
He knows your name. He can look it up.

227
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,860
不  我不小心在对讲机上
No, I overheard the lady coach

228
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,360
听到那个女教练的战术安排
call her play on my walkie-talkie,

229
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,250
然后我改了我的防守策略赢了比赛
and I changed my defense to win the game.

230
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,460
现在我焦虑发作  我必须坦白
And now I'm having anxiety, and I have to confess.

231
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,310
不行  你不能坦白
No, you-you are not gonna confess.

232
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,290
你给我把焦虑揉成一个小球
You're gonna smush that anxiety into a little ball,

233
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,070
再塞到你灵魂里那个专门用来
and you're gonna push it into that little, tiny hole

234
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,050
密封童年阴影的小洞里去
in your soul where childhood traumas go.

235
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,800
这里的所有人都是赢家
Everybody here is a winner.

236
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,250
如果最后你成了饭桌上唯一的失败者
I-If you end up being the one loser at the table,

237
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,330
我仅有的收获会是所有人居高临下的同情
I'm gonna get nothing but condescending pity from everybody.

238
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,460
特别是克莱尔那副难以忍受的虚伪嘴脸
Especially Claire, that insufferable phony.

239
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,670
太漂亮了
Hey, so pretty!

240
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,000
-卢克  -歌洛莉亚
- Luke. - Hey, Gloria.

241
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,310
你的刘海真好看
Sure love those bangs.

242
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,640
为什么剪了刘海
What's the story with those?

243
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,310
我知道你一直在躲着我
I know you have been avoiding me

244
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,930
因为根本没有乔身处险境的合成照片
because there are no Photoshopped pictures of Joe in danger.

245
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,990
而你这个问题的答案很简单
And the the answer to your question is very simple --

246
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,130
刘海衬我的脸
They frame my face.

247
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,880
那些照片啊
Oh, those pictures.

248
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,440
就在这
Here we are.

249
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,990
乔捅蜂窝
Joe poking a bees' nest.

250
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,680
{\an8}肯尼迪遇刺案主凶

251
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,680
乔射杀李·哈维·奥斯瓦尔德
Oh, and Joe killing Lee Harvey Oswald.

252
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,090
真可爱
So cute.

253
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,620
杰  卢克是个天才
Jay, Luke is a genius.

254
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,060
谢了  伙计
Thanks, buddy.

255
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,660
你可以去买高级衣服了
You can go do your fancy shopping now.

256
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,420
太棒了  为了弥补我失去的时间
Awesome. To make up for the time I lost,

257
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,650
我要给脚后跟涂上油
I'm gonna baby oil my heels

258
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,350
试鞋时穿脱就快多了
so I can try on shoes faster.

259
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,380
菲尔  你看过卢克合成的这些照片了吗
Phil, did you see this Photoshop stuff that Luke did?

260
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,700
他真是个魔术师
He's a real magician.

261
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,520
我想这是有其父必有其子
I guess he came by it honestly.

262
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,670
这话对我来说意义非凡  杰
That means the world to me, Jay.

263
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,220
我的人生是场谎言
I'm living a lie.

264
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,340
克莱尔  这家里的每个人都是赢家
Claire, everyone in this family's a winner

265
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,450
除了我
except for me.

266
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,330
我变我变我变废柴
Abraka-failure.

267
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,460
准备好灌水了吗
Ready to fill this thing up?

268
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,730
{\an8}当天早些时候

269
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,060
我们之所以在这里拍
The-The whole reason we're here

270
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,480
就是为了用泳池水  能重复利用
is to use the pool water, which is recyclable.

271
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,620
我算是可持续魔术运动的大人物
I'm sort of a hero in the sustainable magic movement.

272
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,040
我可不想失去三只环保绿兔的评级
I'd hate to lose my three green rabbits rating.

273
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,230
好吧
Okay.

274
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,530
我们这就开拍吗
Should we start filming?

275
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,180
当然  好  当然
For sure. Yeah. For sure.

276
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,940
我认为我或许该先休息一下
I-I-I think I'll-I'll probably just take a quick minute.

277
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,860
年轻时我表演什么魔术都不害怕
As a young man, I had no fear of any trick

278
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,550
任何被困在狭小空间的魔术都行
where I was jammed into tight spaces --

279
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,990
盒中狐  另一个牧羊人
Fox in a Box, The Wrong Shepherd,

280
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,770
爱因斯坦的鸟浴盆
Einstein's Birdbath.

281
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,190
不过最近  我多少有一点幽闭恐惧
Lately, though, I have had a touch of claustrophobia,

282
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,440
通常我只要
which is usually cleared up

283
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,390
给非常支持我的妻子打通电话就好了
by a quick call to my super-supportive wife.

284
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,980
你终于接电话了
Oh, you finally picked up.

285
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,570
不  没有紧急状况
No, no, it's not an emergency.

286
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,130
我只是...你在听吗  克莱尔
I just -- Hello? Claire?

287
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,520
等着你的指令呢  老爸
Just give me the word, Dad.

288
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,150
好
Yep.

289
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,670
我们
Let's...

290
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,850
-我们开始吧  -好  准备好了吗
- Let's do this. - Great. Ready?

291
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,740
-好了  -开拍
- Yeah. - And...action.

292
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,650
您好  恭喜您购买了这个
Hello, and congratulations on your purchase

293
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,230
诺曼底电话亭
of the Normandy Phone Booth.

294
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,480
接下来我将演示
The following will demonstrate

295
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,480
您为生活"拨动"了多少乐趣
just how much fun you've...dialed up.

296
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,710
今天就是登陆日
Here we are on D-Day.

297
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,460
该死的空中支援在哪
Where's the damned air support?

298
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,560
太好了
Oh, good.

299
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,960
有个电话亭
A p-phone booth.

300
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,770
我听说纳粹们在电话亭里设置了陷阱
I hear the Nazis have booby-trapped these,

301
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,790
但我...
but I will...

302
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,080
我绝对会以身犯险  给盟军司令部打电话
I definitely will take the risk of calling Allied Command.

303
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,010
您好  上将
Hello, General.

304
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,590
是的  我们被敌人包围了
Yes, the enemy is all around us.

305
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,460
火力很猛
Blast!

306
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,650
这个电话亭里设置了陷阱
This is one of the phone booths that's booby-trapped.

307
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,830
不
Oh, no!

308
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,430
是的  上将  敌人正在逼近
Yes, General, the enemy is closing in!

309
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,150
我们无路可逃...
There's no esca-

310
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,770
海莉  快放我出去
Haley! Get me out of here!

311
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,190
海莉是谁  我是卢瑟福护士
Who's Haley? I'm Nurse Rutherford.

312
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:26,880
如果我不能表演这个魔术
If I can't do this trick,

313
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,240
我的魔术用品店会沦为小型商场的笑柄
my magic shop is gonna be the laughingstock of the mini-mall.

314
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,210
而那里还有一家过时多年的租片店呢
And there's still a Blockbuster there.

315
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,220
亲爱的  我知道你最近过得不顺
Honey, I know you're going through something,

316
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,790
但你不能告诉别人
but you need to keep it to yourself,

317
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,370
因为我们决不能成为今年家里的失败者
because we will not be the loser family this year.

318
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,780
-克莱尔  -怎么
- Claire. - Yeah?

319
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,870
我想到了一个天才点子
I had a genius idea.

320
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,330
你的比赛路线正好经过普利切特衣橱
Your race went right by Pritchett's Closets.

321
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,520
把保全摄像调出来
Pull the security tape.

322
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,820
我们用你领先的画面冲副大广告
We'll blow up a frame of you in the lead and run a big ad --

323
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,700
"普利切特  三十年来一直领先于他人"
"Pritchett's. Leading the Pack for 30 Years."

324
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,730
-天才  -太赞了  老爸  真棒
- Genius! - I love it, Dad! Yes!

325
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,530
我这就去
I am on that!

326
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,620
我们有麻烦了
We have a problem.

327
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,340
是我有麻烦了
I had a problem.

328
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,380
{\an8}当天早些时候

329
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,140
你好
H-H-Hello?

330
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,730
你好  该死
Hello -- Damn it.

331
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,560
菲尔  你最好是有紧急状况
Phil, this better be an emergency.

332
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,040
你终于接电话了
Oh, you finally picked up.

333
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,810
不  没有紧急状况  我只是...
No, no, it's not an emergency. I just --

334
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,490
我在赛跑  歌单都因为你乱套了
I'm running a race, and you just screwed up my playlist!

335
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:16,990
从那一刻起
From that point on,

336
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,250
我就不在赛跑路线上了
I was no longer on the actual race course.

337
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,090
谢谢你
Thank you!

338
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,790
谢谢
Thanks.

339
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,700
后来可能在某个转角我又兜回到比赛路线上
I guess I hit a point where I funneled back onto the course.

340
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,970
我的确注意到我的体能
I did notice that I seemed to have more energy 

341
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,620
似乎比我前面的几个人充沛许多
than the few people in front of me,

342
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,580
但我当时没多想
but I didn't-I didn't think much of it.

343
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,200
{\an8}火鸡跑  终点线

344
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,480
我做到了  我赢了我赢了
I did it! I won! I won!

345
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,210
你看到了吗  宝贝  我赢了
Did you see that, honey? I won!

346
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,130
不  你没赢
Uh, no, you didn't.

347
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,070
我一直站在五千米标志那  根本没看到你
I was standing at the 5K mark and never saw you.

348
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,170
-什么  -克莱尔
- What? - Claire!

349
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,630
我刚才在商店里  我看到你赢了
I was at the store, and I saw you win!

350
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,120
亲爱的
Oh, honey!

351
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,760
我认识她
I know her!

352
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,000
她是我继女
She's my stepdaughter!

353
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:56,910
普利切特衣橱的保全摄像里
There's not gonna be any footage

354
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,320
根本不会有你跑过去的画面
of you running past Pritchett's Closets

355
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,970
因为9.6公里的赛程你少跑了3公里
because you cut two miles out of a six-mile race.

356
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,650
你最好告诉外公你没赢
Better tell Grandpa you didn't win.

357
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,290
你真是我的道德指南针
Oh, you are my moral compass.

358
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,480
所以我今天一天都不想再和你说话了
Which is why I don't want to talk to you for the rest of the day.

359
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,380
卢克
Luke!

360
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,130
帮我个忙  不许多问
I need a favor, no questions asked.

361
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,470
你需要什么  电话卡吗
What do you need? Phone cards?

362
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,150
不  我需要你合成一张
No. I need you to Photoshop a picture of me from today

363
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,090
我今天跑过普利切特衣橱的照片
running in front of Pritchett's Closets.

364
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,390
没问题
No problem.

365
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,930
-没问题  -我...
- No problem. - I --

366
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,690
我想拍张你和克莱尔的照片
I want to grab a picture of you and Claire.

367
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,610
我想上传到内缝线账号上
I want to post it on my Inseam account.

368
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,740
内缝线是什么
Oh, what's Inseam?

369
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,080
我用来找自制成衣图样的软件
I use it for home tailoring.

370
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,210
-克莱尔  -怎么
- Claire. - Yeah?

371
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,490
你能过来一下吗
Could you get in here, please?

372
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,720
-我的两个超级明星  -好啊
- My two superstars. - Okay!

373
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,200
真不敢相信你膝盖不好还赢了比赛
Can't believe you won with that bad knee.

374
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,240
还好  如果有人想偷奖牌的话
Well, at least if somebody tries to steal that thing,

375
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,420
他们得和这兄弟过过招
they got to get through this guy.

376
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,550
我不过是做了任何英雄会做的事
I just did what any hero would do.

377
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,810
-没什么  -你化妆了吗
- It's... - Are you wearing makeup?

378
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,580
是的  为了遮脸上的淤伤
Uh, well, yeah. I got a bruise.

379
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,010
你不是说你一喊就把他吓跑了吗
I thought-I thought you screamed and he ran away?

380
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,140
我们还是发生了肢体冲突的
Uh, well, there was a-there was a scuffle.

381
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,450
你听从了本能
You went with your instinct.

382
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,400
反抗还是逃跑  你反抗了
Fight or flight. You fought.

383
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,370
我要把这张照片发到内缝线上
I'm gonna post this on Inseam.

384
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,870
双击
Double-click.

385
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,020
该死的
Damn it.

386
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,170
你反抗了
You fought.

387
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,030
你反抗了
You fought?

388
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,880
你跟这个"闯空门的"多近距离接触了
How close did you get to this "intruder"?

389
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,600
克莱尔  你差不多够了
Okay, Claire. That is just about enough.

390
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,710
米奇尔遭受了创伤
Mitchell suffered a trauma,

391
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,310
我不喜欢你这种嘲讽的语气
and I don't appreciate your mocking tone.

392
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,370
容我们失陪  好吗
Excuse us. Okay?

393
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:12,980
谢谢你  亲爱的
Thank you, sweetie.

394
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,980
我们都能确定两件事
Okay, look, we both know two things for certain --

395
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,270
我穿珊瑚色特好看
I look fabulous in coral,

396
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,590
你根本没打跑过任何闯空门的人
and you didn't fight off any intruder.

397
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,700
这是有背景故事的
There-There is a backstory.

398
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,360
1984年夏天
In the summer of 1984,

399
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,770
在《小子难缠》的影响下
inspired by "The Karate Kid,"

400
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,180
我那阵子特别沉迷于武术
I went through a martial arts phase.

401
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,060
当小卡把那副双节棍拿回家时
When Cam brought those nunchucks home,

402
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,190
我实在是无法抗拒
it was just too much to resist.

403
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,330
你好啊  老朋友
Hello, old friend.

404
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,210
三十年后  又一次到了
30 years later, once again,

405
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:37,250
使出扫堂腿  技惊四座的时候了
it was time to sweep the leg.

406
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,050
天啊  不
Oh, God. Oh, no!

407
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,390
-你为什么不和我说实话  -我不知道
- Why didn't you just tell me? - I don't know.

408
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,640
你进门就问我是不是有人闯进来了
You-You walked in, and you asked if there was a break-in,

409
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,910
我当时很窘迫  还可能脑震荡了
and I-I was embarrassed and possibly concussed,

410
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,500
所以我就顺水推舟
so I just -- I went with it.

411
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,400
再说不能让我爸和克莱尔知道  明白吗
Besides, my dad and Claire cannot know, okay?

412
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,740
《小子难缠》上映的那年夏天  他们都叫我"功妇"
That whole "Karate Kid" summer, they called me "Kung Sue."

413
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,260
火鸡10分钟后就好了
Turkey is gonna be ready in 10 minutes!

414
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,970
-菲尔在哪  -我会告诉他
- Where is Phil? - I'll let him know.

415
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:14,930
好
Okay.

416
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,480
-再10分钟  -我做不来
- 10 minutes. - I can't take it!

417
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,510
你就深呼吸  老爸
Just breathe, Dad.

418
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,850
我们要克服你的恐惧
We are breaking this fear of yours.

419
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,690
我要死了
I'm dying here!

420
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,670
看着我
Look at me.

421
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,950
你想要你的余生
Do you want to spend the rest of your life

422
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,990
都只是一名开放空间魔术师吗
as an open-space magician?

423
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,920
这就对了
Yeah.

424
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,210
杰  我在内缝线上看到乔的学校举办了
Jay, I saw on Inseam that there was a Thanksgiving pageant

425
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,640
感恩节大会
at Joe's school.

426
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,950
你为什么没告诉我
Why didn't you tell me?

427
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,450
我忘了嘛
I totally forgot.

428
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,850
乔一周没上学了
Joe hasn't been in school for a week.

429
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,790
我跟他的老师起了点争执
I had a falling-out with his teacher.

430
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,510
然后被叫去校长办公室
And got sent to the principal's office.

431
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,770
你对巴里什老师说了挺难听的话
You said some pretty harsh things to Mrs. Barrish.

432
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,710
那是因为她在计划的餐会
In my defense, um, this banquet she's planning

433
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,480
不符合史实
is not historically accurate.

434
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,220
比如说  我不记得在首次感恩节餐会上
For example, I don't remember a tandoori chicken option

435
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,600
有印度咖喱鸡啊
at the first Thanksgiving.

436
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,630
我们学校有不同文化种族的孩子
We have children here from many ethnicities,

437
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,570
我们想让大家都有参与感
and we try to make them all feel included.

438
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,650
尽管如此  史书上也没写过餐会时  印第安人
Be that as it may, history does not record Pocahontas

439
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,960
请英国探险家帮忙递生鱼片寿司卷
asking John Smith to pass the sashimi roll

440
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,070
而英国知名军官也在一旁
while Myles Standish helps himself

441
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,320
给自己来点无麸质墨西哥煎蛋
to gluten-free huevos rancheros!

442
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,100
之后火气越来越大  我们被逐出学校
After that, it got heated, and we got expelled.

443
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,120
"我们"吗
"We"?

444
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,400
他们会打来的
But they'll call.

445
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,530
始终需要我的银子
They need my check.

446
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,540
为什么学校什么都没告诉我
Why didn't the school tell me anything?

447
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,130
好像我不在电邮通知名单上了
It's like I am off their e-mail list.

448
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,900
我都没看到过他的变装服
I didn't even see the costumes.

449
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,490
他不用变装啊
Well, he didn't have a costume.

450
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,270
他是解说员  他负责说出整个故事
No, he was the narrator. Kid told the whole story.

451
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,770
宝贝
Ay, papi.

452
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,470
你当时一定超可爱
You must have been so cute.

453
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,190
晚餐的时候给大家表演一次吧
Why don't you perform it for everybody at dinner?

454
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,650
我去拿我的手机  我们得录下来
I'll go get my phone, and we'll film it.

455
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,330
-好吗  -没问题
- Okay? - Yes.

456
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,600
小家伙  我得最快时间帮你补课
I gotta get you up to speed in a hurry, buddy.

457
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,140
感恩节的故事  开始
The story of Thanksgiving. Here goes.

458
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,120
没用
It's no use!

459
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,330
我做不到
I can't do it!

461
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,830
我了个去  她成功了
Sonuvabitch, she did it!

462
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,100
你们看到了吗
See that, people?

463
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,620
又一个超越自己巅峰的人  都感谢我
Another person doing their best, thanks to me.

464
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,290
现在可以开吃了
It's time to eat.

465
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,590
谷歌
Hey, Google,

466
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:19,110
火鸡还要多久
how much time left on the turkey?

467
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,060
两分钟
Two minutes.

468
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,660
看到没  我能控制那个神经病甜甜圈
See? I can control that crazy doughnut,

469
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,760
也成功达到十万步
I can do the steps.

470
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,370
我做到了两件事
I have two achievements,

471
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,950
而其他人只做到了一件
and the rest have only one.

472
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,180
所以外公真的靠
So, Grandpa really motivated you

473
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,000
说你做不到什么而激励了你是吧
by telling you you couldn't do something, huh?

474
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,620
我要看看这个计步器  我写报告要用
I need to see that My StepCounter for a paper I'm writing.

475
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,330
大家都成功做到了一些事
Everybody achieved something today,

476
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,470
现在轮到乔了
so now it's Joe's turn.

477
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,370
乔
Joe...

478
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,300
跟我们说说第一个感恩节的故事
tell us about the first Thanksgiving.

479
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,360
来吧  小家伙
Come up here, buddy.

480
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,410
你能行
You got this.

481
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:47,250
曾有一片大地住着不信神的原住民
There was once a land of godless natives.

482
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,680
他们愚蠢无知
They did not know any better

483
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,300
直到某天  白人们来了
until, one day, the white man arrived.

484
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,480
这是什么鬼
What is this?

485
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,830
白人们可怜这些原始人
The white man took pity on these primitives

486
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,500
教导他们如何耕种土地
by teaching them to cultivate the land.

487
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,920
但他们的善良被误会为侵略
But their kindness was mistaken for aggression,

488
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,300
所以战争开打了
and a war began.

489
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,660
这是哪门子的鬼学校
What kind of school is this?

490
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,460
-我小时候学到的也是这样  -什么
- This is what I was taught. - What?

491
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,180
最后  一切回归和平
Eventually, peace was restored,

492
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,780
我们还送给了他们我国最高荣誉
and we bestowed them with our nation's highest honor --

493
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,970
让他们冠名橄榄球队
naming football teams for them.

494
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,930
乔  这是什么短剧
Joe, what play is this?

495
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:22,070
我没有演出短剧  我都没上学了
I wasn't in a play! I don't go to school anymore!

496
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,460
好啦  对啦
All right, fine.

497
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,450
我们被踢出来了可以吗
We got kicked out, okay?

498
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,080
跟校长小小吵了一架
Little argument with the principal.

499
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,290
你怎么可以骗我
You've been lying to me

500
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,420
亏我还一直夸你是个超棒的父亲
while I was celebrating you as an amazing father?

501
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,070
歌洛莉亚  奇怪了
Hey, Gloria, this is weird.

502
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,150
我下载了你的计步器数据
You know, I downloaded your My StepCounter data

503
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,000
到我电脑里
onto my computer,

504
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,600
数据显示你今早走的路线
and it's showing your path this morning

505
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,040
跟我妈妈去赛跑的路线是一样的
was the same route my mom took in her race.

506
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,220
我怎么可能跑得到十万步
I was never going to get 100,000 steps.

507
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,360
一直到后来我知道克莱尔要去火鸡赛跑
But then I learned that Claire was going on a Turkey Trot.

508
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,780
第二次我抱她时
The second time I hugged her,

509
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,260
比第一次不容易  因为她浑身是汗
it was a little harder because she was really wet.

510
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,460
所以我基本上就是你的计步代跑骡吗
So I'm basically just your StepCounter mule?

511
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,990
我还以为你在乎我这场跑步呢
I thought you cared about my race.

512
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,270
我很爱你  克莱尔
I love you very much, Claire,

513
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:04,380
但我对你运动真的很没兴趣
but your exercise doesn't really interest me.

514
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,380
等等  克莱尔什么时候经过公司的来着
Hang on. When did Claire run past Pritchett's Closets?

515
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,920
因为上面显示她压根就没靠近过那里
'Cause this thing says she never got near it.

516
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,340
爸  估计是计步器出错了
Well, it's probably the StepCounter made a mistake.

517
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,000
是吗  还是...
Oh, yeah, did it? Or -- Or --

518
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,500
还是你绕捷径了
Or did you take a little shortcut?

519
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,720
才没有  应该是我跑太快
No, I was probably going so fast

520
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,020
它都跟不上我的脚步
it couldn't even keep up with me.

521
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,140
-我有照片为证  -让我看...
- I have a picture of it. - Let me see.

522
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,140
卢克
Luke?

523
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,460
你们看
And there you go.

524
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,240
很清楚能看到我跑过普里契特衣柜公司
That is me clearly running in front of Pritchett's Closets.

525
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,460
对啊  窗上还有
Oh, yeah, yeah. With a Reagan/Bush poster

526
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,710
84年总统大选的海报呢
in the window, huh?

527
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,480
照片是假的
The photo is a fake.

528
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,620
不能怪我  是曼尼改的图
It's not my fault. Manny made it.

529
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,580
曼尼改了所有的图吗
Manny was photoshopping everything?

530
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,910
所以乔真的发生危险了吗
So Joe was in real danger?

531
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,550
我没想到你这么轻易
I did not realize how easy it would be

532
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,760
就能把线索都连上
for you to connect those dots.

533
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,110
对你挺失望的  卢克
Pretty disappointed in you, Luke.

534
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,460
他从哪学坏的  我想大家都懂
Well, you know, it's easy to see where he learned it from.

535
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,120
他老妈就是个骗子
His mother's a cheater!

536
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,840
什么  你少跟我搞这套义愤填膺的了
What?! Oh, don't get so hot and bothered. Uh-huh! Mm.

537
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,110
-你的妆都要花了  你这...  -别碰我
- Your makeup's already running, and what do... - Stop it.

538
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,660
你的淤青上有个中文字吗
Do you have a Chinese character on your bruise?

539
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,640
估计是闯入的人打我时  他戒指的字印的
Yeah, it's probably an imprint from the intruder's ring.

540
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,980
他...  我确定他肯定是混什么帮派之类的
He was -- I'm sure he was in a gang of some sort.

541
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,030
老实交代吧  米奇尔
Just give it up, Mitchell.

542
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,590
他玩我以代理副校长职权
He knocked himself out with some nunchucks

543
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,800
没收的双节棍时不小心打到了自己
that I confiscated as acting vice principal.

544
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,090
天啊  功妇又回来了
Oh, my God! Kung Sue is back.

545
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,160
老爸  你听到了吗
Daddy, did you hear that?

546
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,560
小卡  小卡不是靠实力赢的球赛
Well, Cam -- Cam didn't really win the football game.

547
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,360
他从对方女教练那里偷听人家战术
Uh-huh. He stole the last play from the lady coach!

548
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,870
是意外  我不小心在我做为代理副校长
Accidentally! I overheard it on a walkie-talkie

549
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,790
必需要有的对讲机里听到的
that I require as an acting vice principal,

因为我基本就是个警长

Is he talking as Tony Ranzetti or as Phil?

575
