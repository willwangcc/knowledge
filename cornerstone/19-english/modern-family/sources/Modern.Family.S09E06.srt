23
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,760
看啊  量子涨落
Behold the Quantum Flux --

24
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,270
{\an8}量子涨落
是在空间任意位置对于能量的暂时变化

25
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,270
通往过去的魔法大门
a magic portal to the past,

26
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,160
有些人称之为"时间机器"
what some might call a "Time machine."

27
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,100
你们该"哇"了
This is where you guys go "Oooh."

28
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,170
-不要  谢谢  -继续吧
- No, thank you. - Just get on with it.

29
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,430
是的  "哇"
"Ooh," Indeed.

30
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,600
我在办爸爸和歌洛莉亚的结婚十周年纪念派对
I'm throwing Dad and Gloria's 10th anniversary party,

31
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,160
而菲尔是部分娱乐项目
and Phil is part of the entertainment.

32
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,300
我要让歌洛莉亚在众人面前消失
I'm gonna make Gloria seemingly dematerialize,

33
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,150
然后令人惊奇地穿越到过去
then wondrously travel back through time,

34
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,480
最后穿着婚纱重新出现
and then rematerialize in her wedding dress.

35
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,960
她要在箱子里换衣服
She's gonna change her clothes in a box.

36
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,680
所以我对你在台上介绍我这事很紧张
This is why I'm nervous about you introducing me.

37
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,960
我开玩笑的  你会表现得很棒的
I'm kidding! You're gonna be great.

38
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,150
他最好发挥出色
He better be great.

39
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,940
我希望爸爸和歌洛莉亚的派对十分完美
I want Dad and Gloria's party to be perfect.

40
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,040
当年我在婚礼上还挺讨人厌的
I was kind of a pill at their wedding.

41
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,020
我那时候还没完全接受歌洛莉亚
I hadn't fully accepted Gloria yet.

42
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,910
而且我觉得我亲妈会如此下场我有一点责任
And I feel a little responsible for what happened with my mom.

43
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,500
我在婚宴上灌了她三杯
I fed her, like, three drinks at the reception.

44
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,070
想缓和一下气氛嘛
You know, just to take the edge off.

45
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,110
我是歌洛莉亚  吻我  快吻我
I'm Gloria! Kiss me! Oh, hey, kiss me!

46
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,640
不  天啊
No, no! Oh, geez!

47
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,750
妈妈
Mom! Mom!

48
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,400
她差点就把门框都扯掉了
She almost took the doorframe off.

49
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,960
她进入了虫洞
Into the wormhole she goes.

50
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,640
时钟倒转
Clocks turn backwards,

51
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,030
日历重新一页页恢复
calendar pages re-attach themselves,

52
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,450
看呀
and behold!

53
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,800
美丽的新娘
The beautiful bride!

54
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,210
各位  你们不觉得激动吗
Guys! This isn't exciting to you?

55
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,360
用一下想象力啊
Use your imaginations.

56
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,650
脑补到时候是我站在穿着新娘服的
Picture me standing next to Gloria

57
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,090
歌洛莉亚旁边
in a wedding dress.

58
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,570
就这样吧
We're done.

59
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,110
米奇尔  你取蛋糕了吗
Mitchell, did you get the cake?

60
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,650
嗯  我都搞定了
Yeah, yeah. I got everything.

61
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,150
好  我得在爸爸家跟你碰头
Okay, good. I'll have to meet you at Dad's.

62
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,520
我得跟菲尔一起去取魔法箱子
I need to go with Phil to pick up his magic box.

63
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,630
你跟菲尔说了
Oh, and, hey, you told Phil

64
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,470
别跟小卡提变魔术的事  对吧
not to mention the trick to Cam, right?

65
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,170
如果小卡发现了  他会想让
If Cam finds out, he's just gonna want us

66
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,870
我俩也表演一番的
to do some kind of performance, too.

67
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,690
我蛮确定跟他说了别告诉小卡
Pretty sure I told him not to say anything.

68
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,900
我蛮确定你没跟他说
Yeah, pretty sure you didn't.

69
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,970
这是要干嘛
So, uh, what's all this?

70
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,760
这是补偿
This is redemption.

71
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,400
给我个直接的答案就好
Maybe just a straight answer.

72
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,290
那年是2007年
The year was 2007 --

73
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,930
杰和歌洛莉亚的婚宴
the wedding reception of Jay and Gloria.

74
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,770
我们送新婚夫妇的礼物是二重唱
Our gift to the newlyweds was a duet performance

75
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,640
-《溪中小岛》  -《溪中小岛》
- of "Islands in the Stream." - "Islands in the Stream."

76
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,290
没送成这份礼物  因为
A gift that would never be, because...

77
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,460
我记得
I remember.

78
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,840
我在婚宴上灌了我妈妈几杯
I fed my mom a few drinks at the reception.

79
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,260
我真的不想唱歌  所以我想
I really did not want to sing, so I figured

80
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,910
如果我把她灌醉  我就没必要表演了
if I got her a little tipsy, I wouldn't have to perform

81
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,600
因为我得握着她的手
because I'd have to hold her hand...

82
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,390
不  天啊
No, no, no! Oh, geez!

83
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,110
妈妈
Mom, Mom!

84
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,140
之后挽着她的头发让她吐
...and later hold her hair back.

85
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,760
你家人想象了十年  如果表演了会怎样
Well, your family has wondered for 10 years "What if?"

86
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,480
今天  他们将得知答案
Today, they find out what for.

87
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,350
我不确定  小卡
Mm, I don't know, Cam.

88
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,770
我有些生疏了
I'm a little rusty,

89
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,970
在帐篷里音响效果也不好
and acoustics are never good inside a tent.

90
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,130
还有  这场派对的重点不是我们
And -- Oh! This party isn't about us.

91
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,020
会有许多表演者
There's a whole slate of performers.

92
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,280
歌洛莉亚要在箱子里换衣服
Gloria's changing in a box.

93
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,100
这让我们的歌曲串烧更受欢迎了
Which makes our medley all the more welcome.

94
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,210
现在成了歌曲串烧吗  不
It's a medley now? No! No.

95
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,890
我今天绝对不可能以任何形态
In no way, shape, or form

96
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,510
或者形式在我挑剔的家人面前表演
am I performing today in front of my judgmental family.

97
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,950
好吧  我们就这么去派对吧
Fine. We'll just... go to the party.

98
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,020
谢谢
Thank you.

99
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,710
-不要歌曲串烧  -没错
- No medley. ‭- Exactly.

100
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,970
等等  这不是什么陷阱吧
Wait. This isn't a trick --

101
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,590
就三首没联系的歌曲
Just three un-related songs.

102
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,780
你刚同意了  彩排现在开始
You just agreed. Rehearsal starts right now.

103
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,010
准备好了就加入
Jump in when you're ready.

104
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,150
为什么是你在做饭
Why are you cooking?

105
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,700
妈妈有允许你待在这吗
Are you allowed back there?

106
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,650
这是我们的结婚纪念日  
It's our anniversary. 

107
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,480
我不能为你妈妈做点好事吗
Can't I do something nice for your mother?

108
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,960
也许吧
Maybe.

109
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,270
早安  美女
Morning, beautiful.

110
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,580
早餐有西式的煎鸡蛋  辣香肠  玉米薄饼
We have huevos, we have chorizo, we have tortilla.

111
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,230
唯一缺的只有曼尼
What we ain't got is Manny.

112
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,380
很遗憾  他今天不会出席派对
Unfortunately, he's gonna be a no-show at the party today.

113
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,890
我有何能为你做的
What can I get you?

114
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,790
把这些垃圾从我身边拿开
Take that garbage away from me.

115
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,160
我要去散步
I'm going for a walk.

116
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,600
曼尼是我们婚礼的一大亮点
Manny was a big part of our wedding.

117
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,280
他牵着歌洛莉亚走上通道  还表演书法
He walked Gloria down the aisle, did the calligraphy.

118
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,830
我知道他不参加我们的周年派对
And I knew him not showing up to our anniversary party

119
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,710
会让歌洛莉亚心情很不好
would put Gloria in a bad mood.

120
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,220
某种程度来说  我觉得自己有责任
In some ways, I feel responsible.

121
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,020
你又回来了吗
You're home again?

122
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,750
你都上大学了
You're in college.

123
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,390
你不能每周末都回家啊
You can't come back every weekend!

124
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,910
-都不拥抱一下吗  -我爱你
-So no hug? ‭-  I love you,

125
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,850
但是你老待在这里  就不能最大程度地
but you're not making the most of your college experience

126
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,240
体验到大学生活了
by being here all the time.

127
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,520
我大一时  我父亲送我去学校
My father dropped me off my freshman year,

128
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,090
我一直到来年春天才再见到他
and I didn't see him again till the spring.

129
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,500
-想知道为什么吗  -我不知道
- You want to know why? - I don't know.

130
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,010
跟姑娘和打架有关吗
Something about dames and fistfights?

131
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,780
没错  我忙于交朋友
Exactly -- too busy making friends,

132
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,860
泡妞之类的事情
chasing skirts, and things of that nature.

133
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,710
但你母亲和我认为  总待在家里
But your mother and I think it's bad for you

134
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,990
对你没好处
to be here all the time.

135
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,050
所以赶紧走吧
So hit the road,

136
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,440
我们感恩节再见
and we'll see you at Thanksgiving.

137
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,040
等等  我被禁止进入自己的房子了吗
Wait. I'm banned from my house?

138
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,450
别这样想
Don't think of it that way.

139
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,430
你是被禁止进入我的房子
You're banned from my house.

140
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,850
严格说来  歌洛莉亚没参与这一决定
Technically, Gloria was not in on this decision,

141
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,260
意思就是
in the sense that...

142
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,870
她不知道这个决定
she was not in on this decision.

143
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,430
我有点在闹脾气
I was a little grumpy.

144
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,560
我同意在派对上跟菲尔一起
I had agreed to do this magic trick

145
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,100
表演这个魔术
at the party with Phil.

146
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,520
我要进入一个箱子里
I go into a box,

147
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,620
然后穿着我的婚纱出来
and then I come out in my wedding dress.

148
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,720
但是有个问题
But there was a problem.

149
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,820
拉
Pull!

150
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,090
拉不动啊
She won't budge!

151
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,420
唯一合理的解释就是
The only logical explanation

152
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,890
有人溜进了我的衣柜
is that somebody snuck into my closet

153
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,850
把我的婚纱缩小了
and shrunk my wedding dress.

154
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,100
比如我妹妹
Like, probably my sister.

155
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,240
所以过去这周
So for the past week,

156
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,320
我在努力减肥
I've had to, like, get even skinnier

157
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,070
要比我结婚时还要瘦
than I was at my wedding.

158
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,070
你闭嘴
Oh, shut up.

159
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,610
{\an8}飚眼先生的幻想殿堂

160
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,460
别丢人
Be cool.

161
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,570
菲尔  这是魔术商店
Phil, it's a magic shop.

162
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,750
我是来过这店里最不丢人的那个人了
I'm the coolest person that's ever been in here.

163
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,710
他怎么做到的
How does he do it?

164
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,700
我开玩笑的  我知道他怎么弄的
I'm kidding. I know how he does it.

165
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,120
克莱尔  这位就是传奇的飙眼先生
Claire, meet the legendary Mister Ekshun.

166
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,760
你好
Hello.

167
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,790
你耳朵后面是什么
And what's this behind your ear?

168
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,780
毛衣掉毛了而已
Oh, just some sweater fluff.

169
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,510
这地方太棒了
Well, the place looks great.

170
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,090
你能想象天天来这里吗
Can you imagine coming here every day?

171
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,980
真希望是每天都来
I wish it was every day.

172
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,910
我现在那么多巡演要去
I have less and less time for the old Illusionatorium,

173
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,890
越来越没时间打理幻想殿堂了
with all the road jobs I still book.

174
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,650
你可以快速再给我过一遍
Would you mind quickly walking me through

175
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,650
量子涨落魔术吗
the Quantum Flux Illusion?

176
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,050
根据魔术表演法则
Well, according to magic bylaws,

177
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,940
有无执照魔术师在场时
I can't disclose the secret

178
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,350
我不能泄露表演秘密
in the presence of a non-licensed magician.

179
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,400
没问题  我可以去外面
Not a problem. I can just step outside.

180
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,450
胡说
Nonsense!

181
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,370
我们早有准备
We prepare for such things.

182
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,800
五感剥夺头盔
The old sensory-deprivation helmet.

183
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,830
我一戴上这玩意儿
Oh! ‭I put that baby on,

184
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,940
就感觉好像我没有室友似的
it's almost like I don't have roommates.

185
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,850
没错  我...我说过了  可以去外...
Yeah, I, like I said, could just step out--

186
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,210
去外面就可以
Outside would be fine.

187
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,910
她真可爱
She's lovely.

188
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,970
是啊  我超幸运的
Yeah. I'm super lucky.

189
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,910
太感谢你肯帮我了
Thank you so much for helping me with this.

190
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,010
你逗呢
Are you kidding?

191
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,480
要不是你几年前
I wouldn't have this life

192
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,260
推掉了伊斯塔帕游艇上的魔术演出
if you hadn't turned down the magician gig

193
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,100
我根本不可能过上现在的生活
on that Ixtapa cruise years ago.

194
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,170
什么  从来没人找我啊
What? I-I was never offered that job.

195
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,990
是啊  他们说给你打电话  但是都没人接
Yeah, they said they called you and never heard back,

196
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,770
所以他们就来找我了
so they moved on to me.

197
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,570
我根本没接到那电话啊
I never got that call!

198
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,210
我不能呼吸了  我不能呼吸了
I couldn't breathe! I couldn't breathe!

199
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,810
你忘开通风口了
Well, you forgot to turn on the ventilator.

200
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,260
这工作应该是我来做吗
That was supposed to be my job?

201
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,300
不
No.

202
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,770
这本该是我的工作
This was supposed to be my job.

203
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,990
我看起来好蠢
I look stupid.

204
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,070
你看到你妈心情有多差了吧
Hey, you see what a bad mood your mother's in?

205
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,430
那是因为她想念曼尼
That's because she misses Manny.

206
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,360
今天  你就是曼尼
Today, you're Manny.

207
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,080
那她不就会想乔吗
But wouldn't she miss Joe then?

208
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,040
别想多了
Don't overthink.

209
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,160
赶紧进去  装着心里难受
Just go in there, act all heartsick,

210
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,140
告诉她你想喝下午茶
and tell her you want to have high tea.

211
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,380
妈  为什么女孩都是迷啊
Hey, Mom. Why are girls such a mystery?

212
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,720
来个司康饼吧
Have a scone!

213
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,310
出去  我根本见不得那个
Get out of here. I cannot even look at that.

214
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,120
要命
Yikes!

215
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,460
没关系  没事
Shake it off. That's okay.

216
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,680
第一次尝试已经不错啦
That's a good first try.

217
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,040
去拿他的排笛
Go grab his pan flute!

218
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,670
我的新娘怎么样啦
How's my bride?

219
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,330
现在都这么大了
Ay! So big now.

220
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,130
我知道  我也感觉到了
I know. It snuck up on me, too.

221
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,890
但请记住  放弃也是生命的自然过程
But remember, letting go is a natural part of life.

222
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,180
不是  杰  那样一点也不好
No. It's terrible, Jay.

223
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,910
让乔送司康饼进来就更糟了
And sending Joe in here with scones made it worse!

224
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,300
安静点  弗汉希欧
Silencio, Fulgencio!

225
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,910
♪ 古老的黑魔法咒语锁困了我心 ♪
♪ That old black magic has me in its spell ♪

226
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,910
{\an8}That old black magic - Ella Fitzgerald

227
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:26,020
♪ 你的古老黑魔法令我意乱情迷 ♪
♪ That old black magic that you weave so well ♪

228
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,080
到你了  老爸
Take it, Daddy!

229
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,560
米奇尔  你知道吗  我换了莉莉
Oh! Hi, Mitchell. You know what -- I def traded up with Lily.

230
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,300
还好你退出了
I'm glad you backed out.

231
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,240
莉莉  去让你的美妙声带休息下
Lily, why don't you go rest your instrument?

232
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,720
那我就解析一下这个绝妙计划吧
So, uh, just to break down this "foolproof" plan,

233
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,360
你以为这样我就会嫉妒
you thought this would make me so jealous

234
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,580
然后我就会求你让我参演  是吧
that I'd beg to be back in the act, didn't you?

235
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,490
不  我就是发现了与我超合拍的小天才
Um, no. I just found a younger talent that I clicked with.

236
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,870
好吧  很期待你俩的表演
Okay, well, I look forward to watching you two perform.

237
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,560
我超羡慕你有机会看我们的表演
Well, I envy you getting to watch us perform.

238
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,020
莉莉  宝贝  快来
Lily, sweetheart, get in here!

239
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,310
排练还没结束呢
The rehearsal's not over!

240
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,110
时间不等人  我的小歌星
Y-Y-Yeah, time's a-wasting, my little thrush!

241
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,330
快  派对快开始啦
And hurry! The party starts real soon!

242
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,170
好吧  你赢了
Okay, you know what? You win.

243
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:07,860
你知道我是绝不会带那乌鸦嗓上台的
You know I'm never taking the stage with that screech owl.

244
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,150
唱吧
Just sing.

245
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,180
这对你来说很重要的
It would be very important for you.

246
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,520
-对我吗  -是的
- For me? - ‭Yes.

247
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,780
你家人深深着迷我的演出好多次了
Your family has been entranced by my performances many times.

248
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,890
这表演对我可有可无  但在过去的10年里
I don't need this, but over the last 10 years,

249
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,120
我一直看着你在他们面前胆怯
I've watch you shrink in their presence.

250
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,780
你很喜欢唱歌呀
And you love to sing.

251
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,990
就还好吧
I like it fine.

252
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,040
我们出去的时候  你总是第一个
And when we go out, you're the first person

253
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,380
抢过话筒  一唱就是一晚
to grab the karaoke mic and scat the night away,

254
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,690
而且你唱得很好呢
and you're good at it.

255
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,110
你知道人们怎么称呼你吗
You know what people are calling you?

256
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,210
男版艾拉·费兹洁拉
"Fella Fitzgerald."

257
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,930
{\an8}知名黑人爵士女歌手  人称爵士乐第一夫人
也曾唱过"That old black magic"

258
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,630
他们才没有呢
They do not!

259
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,930
有的
Yes, they do.

260
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,730
就一次  我想看到你在你家人面前
And just once, I would love to watch your talent soar

261
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,500
大展才华  让他们永远闭嘴
in front of your family and shut them up for good.

262
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,440
-但如果你不想去...  -管他呢
- But if you don't want to -- - You know what? Screw it.

263
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,430
虽然我也很确定
I don't even care that I'm

264
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,080
你现在就是在拐我  但我不在乎
mostly sure you're manipulating me right now.

265
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,010
我们表演定了
We're doing this.

266
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,950
我就知道你会回心转意  欢迎回来演出
I knew you'd come around. Welcome back to the act.

267
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,970
但这就对我有点太过了
Okay, now, this is a bit much for me.

268
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,400
那...
So...

269
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,550
大胡子  你看到曼尼·迪尔加多了吗
Hey, Beardy. Have you seen Manny Delgado?

270
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,920
我想那位花花公子正忙着呢
I think the make-out king is a little occupied.

271
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,920
你没看到代表"有事"的领带吗
Have you no respect for the ascot?!

272
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,400
你来这干嘛
What are you doing here?

273
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,470
我需要你来参加我们周年派对
I need you to come to our anniversary party.

274
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,950
我以为我不受欢迎[西语]呢
I thought I was persona non grata.

275
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,110
现在我就快要得手[西语]了
Now I'm halfway into flagrante delicto.

276
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,270
这个  我可不会错过
This, I don't miss.

277
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,770
你不来  你妈很伤心呢
Your mother is upset you're not gonna be there.

278
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,680
谁让她当初不让我回家
Well, then maybe she shouldn't have banished me from the house.

279
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,080
我可能不小心让你相信
I may have accidently led you to believe

280
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,800
她也有份做这个决定
that she was part of that decision,

281
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,550
-但实际上...  -我就知道
- when actually -- ‭- I knew it!

282
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,890
我就知道我妈不会这么对她的宝贝儿子[西语]
I knew my mom wouldn't be that mean to her little papi.

283
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,150
曼尼
Manny?

284
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,510
马上  亲爱的
One minute, baby.

285
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,460
-这居然有妞喜欢  -闭嘴
- That's been working? - Shut up.

286
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,270
因为你  我冷落了我妈一周
So, I've been icing my mother for a week because of you?

287
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,770
她肯定觉得我是最差的儿子
She must think I'm the worst son.

288
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,340
那就回家让她开心
Then come home and make her day.

289
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,280
我才不会丢下这些  回家救你一命呢
I'm not dropping everything to come home and bail you out.

290
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,870
或许明天可以  而且我要告诉她
Tomorrow, maybe -- and I'm telling her

291
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,720
-你是我不回去的原因  -等下等下
- you're the reason I haven't been around. - Hold on. Hold on.

292
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,640
她通过我知道这件事比较好
It's better if she hears it from me.

293
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,060
我得变个说法
I just have to spin it

294
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,240
说成我这么做是为你好就行了
as if it's something I did in your best interest.

295
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,410
而我还得支持你的鬼话
And I'm supposed to back that up

296
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,150
装出一副这样对我更好的样子...
like I'm somehow better off because --

297
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,480
你去哪呢  熊宝宝
Where'd you go, baby bear?

298
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,200
这就来  熊宝宝
Coming, baby bear.

299
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,080
不用谢我
You're welcome.

300
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,250
但怎么两个人都叫熊宝宝
But two baby bears?

301
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,570
我还是新手
I'm new at this.

302
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,660
克莱尔  问你个小问题
Hey, Claire. Quick question.

303
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,910
我看到你只安排了米奇和我唱一首歌
I see that you only have Mitch and I down for one song.

304
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,530
这不够讲一个完整的故事
Which isn't enough time to tell a story.

305
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,690
我们愿意把歌单缩减到六首歌
So we would be willing to cut our set list to six songs.

306
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,780
好  那就一首吧
Cool. So we'll keep it at one?

307
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,320
好吧  那五首短的呢
Okay, so five quick songs, then?

308
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,580
-一首  -这样吧  你现在答应
- One song. ‭- Yeah, I would be willing

309
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,700
我就同意只表演三首歌
to close this right now at three songs.

310
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,600
一首短的
One quick song,

311
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,330
如果你企图开始介绍乐队成员
and if you so much as begin to introduce the band,

312
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,640
我就切断电源
I'll cut the power off.

313
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,130
你怎么能用这个态度和表演者说话
Okay, that is not the way you talk to talent.

314
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,140
歌洛莉亚
Gloria?

315
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,460
我在卫生间  进来吧
I'm in the bathroom! Come in!

316
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,310
我是菲尔
I-It's Phil.

317
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,620
进来
Come in!

318
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,500
菲尔·邓菲
Phil Dunphy.

319
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,550
菲尔
Phil!

320
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,980
裙子在那边的防尘袋里
The dress is in that bag over there.

321
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,730
太好了  我会藏到时间机器的夹层里的
Oh, great. I'll hide it in the back of the time machine.

322
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,740
你...
You, uh...

323
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,410
你这是在为摔跤比赛做准备吗
You got a big wrestling match coming up?

324
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,890
我今天不太顺遂
I am having a bad day.

325
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,910
我没心情唠家常
I don't feel like doing the chitchatting.

326
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,310
我今天也过得不太好
Not having a great day myself.

327
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,030
我十五年前错过了一通电话
Missed a phone call 15 years ago

328
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,710
那本能展开我身为魔术师的第二事业
that could have launched a second career as a magician.

329
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,860
我本能拥有一切
I could've had it all.

330
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,290
白天是房产经纪人  晚上是魔术师
Realtor by day, magician by night.

331
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,620
就像那部我没写完的摇滚歌剧的主人公一样
Just like the hero of that rock opera I never finished.

332
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,800
菲尔  我说了我没心情唠家常
Phil, this feels like the chitchatting.

333
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,700
我或许该走了
Well, I should probably get going.

334
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,860
这些蒸汽会让我的西装起皱
The steam's starting to pucker up my suit.

335
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,300
做完了
Done.

336
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,040
我参加你婚礼时穿的就是这身西装
It's the same suit I wore to your wedding.

337
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,520
真不敢相信变得这么宽松了
Can't believe how loose it's gotten.

338
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,800
我很荣幸地向大家介绍
And now it is my pleasure to bring up

339
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,260
我们的第一对特别演出嘉宾
the first of our very special entertainers.

340
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,920
他们将带来一首歌
Here to perform one song,

341
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,620
卡梅隆和米奇尔
Cameron and Mitchell.

342
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,950
放松
Just relax.

343
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,610
好的  记得  这和卡拉OK一样
Okay, now, remember -- it's just like karaoke.

344
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,630
是  是  我明白我明白
Yeah, yeah, I-I got it. I got it.

345
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,630
唱两句就转到我的鼓独奏
Sing a little and then throw to the drum solo.

346
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,570
好的好的
Okay. Okay.

00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:52,830

♪ That old black magic has me in its spell ♪

351
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,140
来一段  钢琴师
Take it, piano guy!

352
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,050
瞧他表演多好
Look at him go.

353
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,400
要知道  他小时候就是个妈宝
You know, he was raised a mama's boy.

354
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,730
现在他是个强壮  有能力的男人
Now he's a strong, capable man

355
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,580
嘴里发出奇怪的声音  听起来像乐器似的
making nonsense noises that sound a lot like instruments.

356
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,360
让我们听听吉他的动静
Let's hear that guitar weep!

357
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,530
我们还有一个人的声音没听到
And there is someone that we haven't heard from yet.

358
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,390
陪我来一段  贝司先生
Take a walk with me, Mr. Bass Man.

359
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:02,140
♪ 面对黑魔法  我又有什么办法 ♪
♪ What do you do when faced with black magic? ♪

360
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,270
谢谢大家  非常感谢
Thank you! Thank you so much!

361
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,850
再来一...
One more ti-

362
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,400
好吧  没了
Okay. Nope.

363
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,550
太谢谢你们了
Thank you very much.

364
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,590
你们真[西语]好
Uh, muy kind,

365
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,250
但我知道你们这样只是为了让我好[西语]受
pero I know you're only doing it to make me feel mas better.

366
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,370
看来你在车里没少听西语教程
Somebody's been listening to Rosetta Stone in the car.

367
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,560
小卡  别这样  有话别憋着
Cam, come on. Talk to me.

368
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,700
你他叽哩哇啦的是怎么回事
What in the skibbity doo wop was that?

369
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,780
你自己带了一票摄影棚现场观众吗
Did you bring your own studio audience?

370
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,110
不是  他们是歌洛莉亚的家人
No. They're Gloria's family.

371
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,320
和某些人不同  他们是有感情的
Unlike some people, they feel things.

372
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,700
小卡  抱歉  我有点忘形了
Cam, look, I'm sorry. I got carried away.

373
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,050
感觉你是故意伤我
It seemed deliberately hurtful.

374
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,330
每个音乐家都得到了独奏的机会
Every musician got a solo

375
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,700
只除了你对他立过婚誓的那一个
except the one you promised to have and to hold.

376
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,180
能别打岔吗
Okay, do you mind?

377
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,190
谢谢合作
Thank you.

378
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,930
小卡  很抱歉我忘了给你独奏的机会
Look, Cam, I-I'm sorry I forgot to throw it to you,

379
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,280
但我当时只是太投入了
but I-I was just swept up in the moment.

380
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,040
那场面令我太陶醉了
It -- That was -- It was exhilarating.

381
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,610
我...  你听到那些人欢呼了吗
I-I -- Did you hear those people cheering?

382
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,780
你确实表演得很精彩
Well... you were brilliant.

383
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,720
虽说不是最慷慨无私的表演  但仍然...
Not the most generous of performances, but --

384
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,000
我在我爱评头论足的家人面前完全无拘无束
I was completely free in front of my entire judgy family,

385
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,550
而这一切都归功于你
and none of that would have happened without you.

386
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,420
我想我听懂你的意思了
Well, I think I hear what you're saying --

387
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,850
你是说有一半的掌声是属于我的
that half of that applause was mine

388
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,000
-因为我让你蜕变了  -好吧
- 'cause I transformed you. - Okay.

389
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,090
这比任何10分钟的鼓手独奏都要好
Well, that's better than any 10-minute drum solo.

390
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,860
你会告诉大家这都是我的功劳吗
So you'll tell everyone this was my doing?

391
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,060
当然了
Of course I will.

392
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,960
过来
Come here.

393
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,150
好了  到时我会把箱子转两次
Okay, I'll spin the box two times,

394
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,620
你有30秒时间换上婚纱
you'll have 30 seconds to change into your wedding dress.

395
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,700
或者我可以换上旧睡衣
Or I change into an old pair of pajamas

396
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,360
让大家知道我和杰在一起后
to show the people how comfortable

397
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,890
有多自在多舒服
I have always been with Jay.

398
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,160
好啊  歌洛莉亚
Oh, yeah. Sure, Gloria.

399
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,170
不如我们把台本扔了
Why don't we just throw the script out

400
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,190
你想说什么就随便说好了
and you can say whatever you want,

401
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,220
反正观众都觉得
'cause the audience already thinks

402
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,450
演员在乱编故事了
the actors make it all up anyway?!

403
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,690
对不起
I'm sorry!

404
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:42,620
怎么回事
What's going on?

405
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,860
没事的  菲尔
It's okay, Phil.

406
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,430
他很难过  因为15年前
He's very upset because 15 years ago,

407
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:50,480
他错过了一通叫他去船上变魔术的电话
he missed a phone call for a job to do boat magic.

408
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,460
你整个下午都在生闷气就为了这事啊
That's why you've been sulking all afternoon?

409
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,130
我的生活本来会完全不同
My life would be completely different

410
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,830
都怪愚蠢的命运
if not for stupid fate!

411
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,710
命运
Fate?

412
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,020
我来问你个问题
Let me ask you something.

413
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,810
好好学习这宝贵的一课
And there's a real lesson here.

414
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,930
你喜欢你现在的生活吗
Do you like how your life turned out?

415
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,730
喜欢
Yeah, sure.

416
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,290
家人超棒  工作稳定  公交椅广告
Great family, steady work, bus benches?

417
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,880
你不在家时我接到了那通电话
I got that call when you weren't home

418
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,150
但一直没告诉你
and never gave you the message.

419
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,200
什么  问号加感叹号
What -- question mark, exclamation point?!

420
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,690
你为什么要那么做
Why would you do something like that?!

421
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,380
为了救他  不让他被自己害惨
To save him from himself.

422
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,590
有时候人需要被轻推一把
People sometimes need a gentle nudge

423
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,770
才能做出正确的决定
to make the right choice.

424
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,820
大家很幸运  因为有我担任这个角色
And, luckily for everyone, I'm here to do it.

425
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,020
不只是推了菲尔
And not just for Phil.

426
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,230
我知道你在想曼尼为什么没来
I know you're wondering why Manny isn't here.

427
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,440
-我敢打赌...  -谁准备好看魔术表演啦
- I b-- - ‭Who's ready for some magic?

428
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,990
菲尔  歌洛莉亚  该你们上场了
Phil, Gloria, you're up.

429
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,590
-老公  你还好吧  -不好
- Honey, you okay? - ‭Nope!

430
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,580
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

431
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,680
科学家会告诉你们
the scientists would have you believe

432
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,570
时间旅行纯属鬼扯
that time travel is poppycock.

433
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:44,320
在人最好的歌洛莉亚与杰这人的大日子上
But today, on the anniversary of the wonderful Gloria and Jay,

434
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,870
我将驳倒那些质疑的声音
I shall confound the skeptics

435
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,220
将这位美丽的女子
and transport this beautiful woman

436
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,990
送回她举行婚礼那一天
back in time to the day of her wedding.

437
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,230
歌洛莉亚  请入箱
Gloria, get in the box!

438
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,750
麻烦来点鼓声
Drumroll, please.

439
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,630
好赞  打鼓
Whoo! Yes, drums!

440
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,940
超棒
Yes!

441
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,220
看  她消失在虫洞里了
Anyway, watch as she disappears into the wormhole.

442
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,770
这就是我的魔术  我表演完了
That's my trick. I'm done.

443
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,200
你表演完了是什么意思  把她带回来啊
What do you mean, you're done? Bring her back.

444
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,910
我准备好了
Okay, I'm ready!

445
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,850
你让我的梦想消失了
You made my dream disappear.

446
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,760
现在你的也消失了
Now yours is gone.

447
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,280
有人吗  我想出来
Hola! I want to come out!

448
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,910
菲尔  菲尔  你在"迪迪"我的派对
Phil. Phil, you are Dede-ing my party.

449
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,510
你爸爸"迪迪"了我的人生
Your father Dede'd my life.

450
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,870
15年前那通叫我去表演的电话是他接的
He's the one who got the phone call 15 years ago

451
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,870
但却从没转告过我
about the magic job and never told me.

452
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
-菲尔  -你家人一直把我当小孩对待
- Oh, Phil. - Your family has always treated me like a child

453
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,360
好像我无法自己做决定
who can't make his own decisions.

454
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,620
连我出席婚礼该穿什么
I couldn't even make an outfit choice for the wedding

455
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,480
你妈妈都要指手画脚
without your mother commenting on it.

456
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,430
所以我当年才偷给了她三杯酒
That's why I slipped her those three drinks at the reception.

457
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,420
这里面好热呀
It's very warm back here!

458
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,580
你必须把歌洛莉亚从箱子里放出来
You need to let Gloria out of that box.

459
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,480
还有
And...

460
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,640
那件事与我爸无关
my dad had nothing to do with that.

461
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,030
是我让他别转告你留言的
I'm the one who told him not to give you the message.

462
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,290
是我没听见"请看"吗
‭Did I miss the "Ta-da"?

463
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,230
菲尔  对不起
Phil, I'm so sorry.

464
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,790
但当时你的工作刚有起色
But your business was just taking off,

465
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:15,450
而孩子们都还小
and the kids were really little.

466
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,540
不  别说了  我不想听到
No, no. I-I -- I don't want to hear it.

467
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,540
原来我老婆才是我不能有魔术事业的凶手
My own wife is the reason I don't have a career in magic --

468
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,590
这我生来就为此的事业
a thing I was born to do?!

469
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,560
快看我
Look at me!

470
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,210
我十年来一点都没变
I haven't changed in 10 years!

471
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,700
歌洛莉亚
Gloria!

472
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,240
你来了  太好了
You came! Thank God!

473
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,610
不是为了你
Not because of you.

474
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,100
想到我妈妈需要我
I couldn't enjoy my time with Denise

475
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,490
我也没办法好好享受跟丹尼丝共处的时光
knowing my mother needed me.

476
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,090
我有稍微享受到一点啦
I mean, I enjoyed it a little.

477
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,630
她是个想用热情取代暴食的舞蹈专业妹子
She's a dance major trying to replace food with affection.

478
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,670
我真的无所谓
I really don't care.

479
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,870
歌洛莉亚
Gloria!

480
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,500
我有个惊喜给你
I have a surprise for you!

481
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,390
我来了
I'm here!

482
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,350
好吧
Okay.

483
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,400
本来还以为会有大一点的反应呢
I was kind of expecting a bigger reaction.

484
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,750
我也以为曼尼来了就能让你负担一轻呢
Yeah, I thought for sure Manny being here would tip the scales.

485
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,200
我才不用谁让我一轻
No! I don't need anyone to do that for me!

486
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,040
别来烦我
Just leave me alone.

487
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,970
你们俩又在玩什么变态把戏了
What kind of sick game are you two playing?

488
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,840
你们到底懂没懂我来这里是放弃了什么啊
Do you have any idea what I gave up to be here?

489
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,440
歌洛莉亚  你到底怎么了
What's going on with you, Gloria?

490
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,430
人家现在穿不下这婚纱了
This dress doesn't fit me anymore!

491
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,480
就因为这个吗
That's it?!

492
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,060
我大老远去曼尼宿舍只是白费功夫吗
I drove all the way to Manny's dorm for nothing?

493
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,080
对对对  你今天牺牲最大了
Oh, because you've made the sacrifice today.

494
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,610
你不懂啦
You don't understand.

495
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,500
我总跟别人说我很努力
I tell people that I work hard

496
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,710
来保持体态与保持年轻
to stay fit and to stay young,

497
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:37,200
但事实上我几乎没下过什么功夫
but the reality is that I barely do anything.

498
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,480
但现在人家的身体越来越...
But now my body is getting...

499
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,480
胖了吗
Bigger?

500
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,700
你好大的胆子
How dare you!

501
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,690
不过是啦
But yes.

502
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,720
但我一直拥有某种外形体态
But I've always looked a certain way.

503
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,800
现在我走形  那我还是什么
And now that I don't, then what am I?

504
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:56,540
就只是一个有辣酱生意的自学美发师
Just a self-trained hairdresser with a hot-sauce business.

505
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,650
那生意还在啊
You still have that?

506
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:02,380
歌洛莉亚  你绝不只是你的外表那么简单
Gloria, you're so much more than how you look.

507
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,910
这种话是说来给
That's what you say to people

508
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,930
人老珠黄的女人听的
that are not that pretty anymore.

509
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,180
你是不是傻啦
Are you insane?

510
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,040
你就算是我这个年纪而且再重14公斤
You could be my age and 30 pounds heavier,

511
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,770
对我来说也还是不可高攀的尤物
and you would still be unbelievably out of my league.

512
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:16,130
听我说  你重了一点  那又怎么样啊
Listen, you gain a couple -- who cares?

513
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,170
过去十年是我人生最美好的一段日子
These have been the best 10 years of my life.

514
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,470
而每一斤肉  每一条皱纹
I'm in it for every pound, every wrinkle,

515
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,670
每一根白发都有我的影子
every gray hair.

516
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,760
要不要这样
Come on!

517
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,520
走  上车
Let's go. Get in the car.

518
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,520
-我们要去哪里  -这就不用你担心了
- Where are we going? - Don't worry about it.

519
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,230
也是  我何须现在开始自己做决定呢
Oh. Why should I start making my own decisions now?

520
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,040
没告诉你那份工作  我很抱歉
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the job.

521
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,730
但你就是那种"有梦就追"的人
You're just such a "go for it" kind of guy --

522
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,570
我也很爱你这点
and I love that about you --

523
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,650
但当时  我们有三个嗷嗷待哺的孩子
but in that case, we had three little kids,

524
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,630
有房贷要付  我心里慌嘛
a mortgage, and I was nervous.

525
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,100
但好歹你做决定时可以带上我吧
You could have at least included me in the decision.

526
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,710
你说得对  你说得没错
You're right! You're right.

527
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:05,190
我也知道一句"我很抱歉"并没有用
And I know "I'm sorry" doesn't begin to cover it.

528
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,150
为什么停下了
Why are we stopping?

529
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,550
我们的孩子都长大了
Well, our kids are grown,

530
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,880
我经营一家公司  你白天工作也很棒
I run a company, you've got a great day job.

531
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,770
我觉得或许是时候让你重拾往日爱好了
I thought maybe it was time you picked up an old hobby.

532
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,390
那是...
Are those -- Uh...

533
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,210
你的新魔术用品店钥匙
Keys to your new magic shop.

534
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,250
我的老天啊
Oh, my God!

535
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,440
去吧
Go on!

536
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,640
-不是吧  -没错
- What?! - ‭I know!

537
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,120
飙眼先生十分乐意地以接近白送价格转让
And Mister Ekshun was willing to let it go for next to nothing.

538
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,750
现在我仔细想想
Which, now that I think of it,

539
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,840
这好像不是个好兆头
is probably not a great sign.

540
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,530
这也太赞了
This is awesome!

541
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,540
"表演[飙眼]先生"的哏  我现在才发现啊
And "Mister Ekshun" -- I just got that!

542
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,360
其实挺好笑的  你用来补偿
It's kind of funny that you're making up

543
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,960
私自替我做决定的方法
for making a decision that should have been mine

544
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,130
就是私自替我做了另一个决定
by making another decision for me.

545
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,370
你是想要还是不想要
Do you want it or not?

546
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,990
-我爱你  -我也爱你
- I love you. ‭- I love you.

547
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,090
法则规定
Bylaws.
