# Technical Interview 

## Why?

> 思考要全面，沟通要流畅，代码要硬核。

* **精心准备**: 胜兵先胜而后求战，败兵先战而后求胜。
* **保持精力**: 面试当天，不要复习。请给当天面试的大脑留满电量的计算资源。
* **平常心态**: 就像和小伙伴一起在解题一样，有问题请当场问。Be a **co-worker** instead of a candidate.
* **当场思考**: 不要依赖记忆，依赖记忆会卡顿，无法呈现出你的逻辑链，而沟通的流畅性却无比重要，请一定一定要现场思考，你可以做得更好哒！
* **自留余地**: Think loud固然好，但有时说话不利于思考。首先是做题(完成)，其次是传达(完善)。 不妨先说：“Could you give me one or two minute to think? I'll tell you my idea later?”
* **系统表达**: 在面试官那里，如果你没说，他便觉得你没有想到。所以，在表达时，一定一定一定要**分类讨论**，全面叙述，细节展开。系统化思考是软件工程师的基本素养。如果觉得时间有限，请总分叙述，一个节点之后适时地问一下：“Would you like me to go into more depth?”

## How?

- **Ask** 
	- Please ask **questions** if you need **clarification**.
	- Why? 
		- We want the interview process to be collaborative.
		- We also want to learn what it would be like to work with you on a day-to-day basis in our open environment.
	- How?
		-  If you are asked a question, but not given enough information to solve the problem, drill down to get the information that you need.
		-  If that information isn’t available, focus on how you would attempt to solve the problem given the limited information you have. Often times at the Company, we have to make quick decisions in the absence of all of the relevant data.
- **Answer**
	- When answering questions, be as **concise** and **detailed** in your response as possible.
	- Why? We realize it’s hard to gauge how much information is too much versus not sufficient enough. 
	- How? An effective litmus test is pausing after your succinct response to ask 
		- if you’ve provided enough detail, 
		- or if the interviewer would like you to go into more depth.
- **Code** 
	- writing scalable, robust, and well-tested code
	- A few missed commas or typos here and there aren’t that big of a deal, but the goal is to write code that’s as close to **production-ready** as possible. This is your chance to show off your coding ability.

		
## Flow 

> Be a co-worker instead of a candidate.

- Should I take care of input input validation?
- Let's write down some **test case** that helps us to understand the problem.
- Can you give me one-two minute to think? I tell you my idea later.
- Can I assume that ... ? **x 10**
- There are several ideas that I come up with. We can use A, B or C. Let's try the most intuitive solution first and improve it step by step. If we have time, we can talk about trade-off of each solution.
- Now, let's focus on solution A and let me write a test-case and run it by hand to help you understand my idea.
- Let us analysis the solution's time-complexity and space-complexity to see if it is good enough. 
- I'll code this solution first. I'll explain my other solutions if we have time.
- We need two variables to represent A and B. 
- Let make the code more readable and let us call it X.
- We need a hashmap to store A **so that** we can access X in O(1) time complexity.
- Ok, we implement the solution basically and let me see if there is any bug or any that I can improve.
- Let me write some different test cases to cover typical use cases.
