### Setting priorities and goals

Time management strategies are often associated with the recommendation to set personal goals. The literature stresses themes such as:

* "Work in **Priority Order**" – set goals and prioritize,
* "Set **gravitational goals**" – that attract actions automatically[citation needed].

These goals are recorded and may be broken down into a project, an action plan, or a simple task list. For individual tasks or for goals, an importance rating may be established, deadlines may be set, and priorities assigned. This process results in a plan with a task list, schedule, or calendar of activities. Authors may recommend a daily, weekly, monthly, or other planning periods, associated with different scope of planning or review. This is done in various ways, as follows:

* ABCD analysis
* Pareto analysis
* The Eisenhower Method
* POSEC method

#### The Eisenhower Method

The "Eisenhower Method" stems from a quote attributed to Dwight D. Eisenhower: "**I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent.**"[12] Eisenhower does not claim this insight for his own, but attributes it to an (unnamed) "former college president."[13]

Using the Eisenhower Decision Principle, tasks are evaluated using the criteria important/unimportant and urgent/not urgent,[14][15] and then placed in according quadrants in an Eisenhower Matrix (also known as an "Eisenhower Box" or "Eisenhower Decision Matrix"[16]). Tasks in the quadrants are then handled as follows.

* Important/Urgent quadrant tasks are **done immediately and personally**, [17] e.g. crises, deadlines, problems.[16]
* Important/Not Urgent quadrant tasks **get an end date and are done personally**, [17] e.g. relationships, planning, recreation.[16]
* Unimportant/Urgent quadrant tasks are **delegated**, [17] e.g. interruptions, meetings, activities.[16]
* Unimportant/Not Urgent quadrant tasks are **dropped**, [17] e.g. time wasters, pleasant activities, trivia.[16]

## What 

### Overview

Time management is the **process** of **planning** and **exercising** **conscious** control of time spent on specific **activities**, especially to increase **effectiveness**, **efficiency**, and **productivity**. It involves a juggling act of various demands upon a person relating to work, social life, family, hobbies, personal interests and commitments with the finiteness of time. Using time effectively gives the person "choice" on spending or managing activities at their own time and expediency.[1] Time management may be aided by a range of skills, tools, and techniques used to manage time when accomplishing specific tasks, projects, and goals complying with a due date. Initially, time management referred to just business or work activities, but eventually the term broadened to include personal activities as well. A time management system is a designed combination of processes, tools, techniques, and methods. Time management is usually a necessity in any project management as it determines the project completion time and scope. It is also important to understand that both technical and structural differences in time management exist due to variations in cultural concepts of time.

The major themes arising from the literature on time management include the following:

* **Creating an environment** conducive to effectiveness (in terms of cost-benefit, quality of results, and time to complete tasks or project),
* **Setting of priorities**,
* The related process of reduction of time spent on **non-priorities**,
* **Implementation** of goals.
